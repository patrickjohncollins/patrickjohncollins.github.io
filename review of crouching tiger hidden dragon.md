Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon transports me to a distant world in the past

exotic land
an imagined China
idealiazed China




is a Chinese film that tells the story of several   




Directed by Ang Lee in 2000, the film 


is the title of a film, released in 2000, 


Pre-industrial China

Temples, palaces, aristocratic homes
Cave dwelling in the desert 
Great beauty in the scenery

Craftsmanship
Decor
Costumes

Sober world
Restraint

Clean

Is this what China used to look like before they started building factories and coal-burning power stations everywhere ?


Or is the scenery Greatly exagerrated, as is everything else in the film

Certain the fight scenes are greatly exaggerated
Super-human reflexes, but also the ability to leap great distances and land with grace

Pushing the limits of the believable

The wire work is reminiscent of The Matrix, released a year prior, although that film took place within the context of a virtual reality, where the rules of physics could be flaunted.  In Crouching Tiger, no such explanation is made.

The run to the bamboo forest provides the pinnacle.
Running up walls and across rooves, but running up bamboo stalks ?

These super-human abilities, where do they come from ?


What rule of law exists ?

A policeman from the provinces

What authority do the main characters have ?

They seem to act with impunity

Killing men

Lawless society


Li Mu Bai  - man
Yu Shu Lien - woman older
Jen - thief


Chinese composure 
Sit, back straight, hands in lap, face unmoving
Not picking and scratching

This perfect motionless constrasts strongly with the increadible speed of the fighting action


I have little knowledge of Chinese culture or the genre of Wuxia.

The wandering swordsman image does appeal to me greatly

Justness ?

Jade Fox clearly comes across as a baddie

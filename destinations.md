I'd like to buy a van in Catalonia and then drive down to Morocco.  While there I would like to purchase many decorative items and pieces of furniture for my future club.  Specifically, I would like to buy rugs, cushions, lamps, slippers, tea pots, ashtrays, tables, and anything else that I find interesting along the way.  I would also like to listen to some performances of classical Andalusian music.


Places I just really want to go.

New Mexico  
Costa Rica  
Kerala  
Iran  
Ethiopia  
Thailand  
Bali  
Tahiti  
Reunion  
Singapore

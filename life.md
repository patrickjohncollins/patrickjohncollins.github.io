Title: Life

	
None of us chooses to be born.  Life is a gift that is thrust upon us.  And what, pray tell, are we meant to do with this gift?  A vexed question, to be sure.

Instinctively, we want to share this gift, this spark of life, giving birth to a future generation who will replace us after our definitive departure.  Unfortunately, there are already billions of us on this planet.  

Does a greater population lead to greater happiness?  The evidence would indicate the contrary, for as we grow in numbers, so we are forced to compete more ardently for the few resources that remain.  And in so doing, we are wiping out swathes of this planet's biodiversity, pumping volumes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and poising the rivers and seas.  I wouldn't call this progress.

Conception is a lottery.  I was lucky to be born healthy, with all my fingers and toes.  I am thankful that I was not born blind, deaf, deformed, paralyzed or otherwise infirm, and feel compassion towards those who suffer thus.  

Though I was born male, I could just as easily have been born female.  Though I was born in London of Irish-Dutch descent, I could have been born Palestinian in Gaza.  I strikes me as illogical to judge someone for choices they did not make.











Though, I was born male, of Irish-Dutch descent, in London in 1981, , of Palestinian descent in Gaza




On my father's side I'm Irish, and on my mother's side I'm part-English, part-Dutch and part-German. 





I was born in 1981 in London of Irish-Dutch descent.




I'm a citizen of the UK and Ireland, I grew up in Johannesburg

- [American Honey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Honey_(film)) (2016)

[Makoto Shinkai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makoto_Shinkai)
- [5 Centimeters per Second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Centimeters_per_Second) (2007)  Stunningly beautiful animation.  A touching love story, although a little too dramatic.
- [Your name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name) (2016)  More stunning animation.  Teenage boy and girl switch bodies in their dreams.  Love the gender bending.
- Weathing you (2019) was terrible, I got bored.  The rain-girl didn't do it for me.

[Bryan Konietzko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Konietzko) and [Michael Dante DiMartino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dante_DiMartino)

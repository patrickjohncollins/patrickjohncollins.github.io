Hi, I'm Patrick J. Collins.  I was born in London, raised [in Johannesburg](/youth-in-joburg/).  Since then, [I've sailed](/sailing-in-greece/) across [the high seas](/cruising-the-canaries/), hitch-hiked [across Europe](/hitchhiking-across-europe/), taken psychadelics, watched my apartment building [burn](/my-building-is-on-fire/), been [arrested](/being-arrested/), been [swinging](/the-margins-of-barcelona/), learnt to speak French and Spanish, amongst [many other adventures](/meanderings/).  Between all that, I've written [a fistful of short stories](/fiction/), a number of musings about the state of the world and [my place in it](/musings/), and far too many [computer programs](/programming/).  I am currently [writing a novel](http://themeparkearth.org).

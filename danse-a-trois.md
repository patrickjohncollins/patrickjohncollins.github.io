title: Danse à trois

I imagine this scene, from a movie, it's morning, a handsom gentleman is in bed, he leans over to the right to kiss a slumbering woman on the head, then he leans over to the left and kisses *another* slumbering women, whereupon he smiles knowingly at the camera.  
Glamourous as this may seem, there are two inconvieniences that I have discovered when sleeping in the middle.  First, I get terribly hot, warmed as I am by two young beautiful females, and secondly when I need to get out of bed to pee I'm not sure if I should wriggle out the bottom or out the top.  That said, things are much better now that we have a king-size bed, as sleeping like sardines in an ordinary double was rather uncomfortable.  
I think it's the dream of all men to make love to two women at the same time, certainly it had been for me, a fantasy as alluring as it was unattainable.  
Most people identify as heterosexual, so I was quite lucky to find myself in an open relationship with a bisexual woman.  She prefers the term sapiosexual, which means she's attracted to intelligent people regardless of their sex.  Despite this, it was not unusual for us to both turn our heads and ogle the ass of a pretty lass.  I enjoyed that we could sit down together on a café terrace and watch the people.  There was no jealousy.  Why, I've been in relationships before when the mere act of looking at another woman would be taken as a sign of infidelity.  Sometimes we'd settle in to watch some porn together, she'd surprise me by putting on videos even more hardcore than I'd considered watching myself.  





When I first arrived in Barcelona I met Mary Rose.  She was my Spanish teacher, and our private classes quickly turned into *very* private classes.  We were already seeing other people.  

We established an open relationship.

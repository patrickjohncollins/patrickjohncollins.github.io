Title: The corridor

How long have I been asleep?  I gently run my fingers across the soft velvet carpet upon which I lie.  I'm dressed, in a suit and a smart pair of leather shoes.

There is a door in front of me, and others further down.  It looks like I might be in a hotel.  I slowly rise.

The corridor is lined with doors, all perfectly identical, stretching to a vanishing point.  It looks impossibly long, hundreds of meters, kilometres even.

I feel a little queasy just looking at it.  I look the other way, but the view is the same.

My legs give way slightly and I crumple against the wall.  I'm feeling a little dizzy.  I look at the floor.  I study the repeating pattern of the carpet for a while.  I try not to look too far down the corridor, just a few doors.

I take a step forward, and then another.  I walk a while.  I pass door after door.  I look back, and realize that I don't know where I was lying.

How did I get here?  What kind of hotel is this?  The doors don't have numbers.  I wonder if they are locked.  I try to open one at random.  It clicks as I turn the knob and swings open easily.  I [step inside](/the-caged-apes/).

As I slam the door shut behind me, I hear a heavy thud followed by clawing and then silence.  My heart thumps in my chest.

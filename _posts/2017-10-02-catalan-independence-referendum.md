title: Catalan independence referendum
date: 2017-10-02

I live in Barcelona.  Yesterday I watched Spanish riot police bludgeon hundreds of peaceful civilians as they went to vote for the independence of Catalonia.

As a citizen of Ireland, I know that my ancestors fought a long and bitter struggle so that Ireland could become a free republic.  The Catalan people too desire their freedom, but they refuse to take up arms.  They stood with their hands open as the blows rained down.  We must stand by them and denounce this oppression.

As a citizen of Europe, I call on all European leaders to welcome Catalonia as a new member state, Barcelona as a new European capital, and Catalan as a new official European language.  There are 7,5 million Catalans, more than: Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Slovakia, Ireland, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta, all existing EU member states.

Visca catalunya lliure!  Freedom for Catalonia!

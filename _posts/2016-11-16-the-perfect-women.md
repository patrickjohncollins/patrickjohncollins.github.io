I'm not a barman, but I do like to mix drinks. Here's my adventurous recipe for what I call "The Perfect Women":  
A heaped spoonful of spontaneity.  
Equal parts of honesty, confidence and intelligence.  
A twist of creativity, a sprig of compassion.  
Shake in some positive energy and sociability.  
A few drops of highly concentrated provocation.  
Patience now.  
Serve in a tall thin glass on a hot summer night.

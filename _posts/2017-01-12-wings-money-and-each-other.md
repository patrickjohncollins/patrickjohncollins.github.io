Have you ever heard of fractional jet ownership? With a remote control in my hand I can press a button at any time and a car will pick me up, drive me to the nearest airport and there a private jet is waiting to fly me anywhere in the world. Yes, this is a thing that exists. It is also very expensive. One of these devices happened to fall in the wrong hands, my hands, and I decided to go wild, [treating the world like one big themepark](https://pjcollins.org/wings-money-and-each-other/).

Back in the middle ages, high-born nobles married off their sons and daughters in order to grow their territorial possessions.  The House of Catalonia married the House of Aragon, and these then married with the House of Castille.  Thus the Kingdom of Spain was born.  Together they drove the Arabs out of the peninsula and then sailed their boats across the Atlantic to conquer most of America.  The Kingdom had become an Empire.  
Centuries passed.  The Empire crumbled.  One by one the colonies cast off their ties and declared their independence.  Today comes the final blow.  A divorce.  Catalonia has had enough, and they want out of the marriage.  No more counselling, no more therapy, just out.  
"Till death do us part" goes the vow.  The Pope refused Henry VIII a divorce, but he defied Rome and went ahead anyway.  And so the Catalans will defy Brussels.  Will they too be excommunicated for their troubles?  I, for one, would like to see the EU grow, not shrink.  
The break up of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, East Timor, South Sudan, many recent cases jump to mind.  Most with a painful dose of violence.  But violence is not necessary.  
Divorces are complicated.  Who gets to have the beach house?  And the collection of fine china?  What about the children?  Let's not even talk about the debts.  This is where the lawyers come in.  Who will step forward and act as a mediator?  I'd like to see the Irish have a crack at it, seeing as they've been down this long road once before.  Any other recommendations?

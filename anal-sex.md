I have had quite a lot of experience in anal sex.

When I propose anal sex to my sexual partners, they are invariably quite afraid.  Their previous experiences have often been painful and otherwise unpleasant, nothing worth repeating.  However, I notice that women really enjoy anal sex once they become accustomed to it, indeed they even demand it.

Vaginal sex always comes first.  The hotter, the better.  Ideally the woman should be very wet.  Her muscles begin to relax, I can bend her further, penetrate her deeper.  I'll slip a finger into her anus intially.  If I feel that her desire is sufficient, I'll place the head of my penis at the entrance to her anus.  It helps if she spreads her cheeks apart.  The penis needs to be hard as steel to enter, a soft penis will bend and fail to enter.  

I hold the shaft of the penis, quite close to the head.  Locating the anus and finding the right angle can actually be quite tricky.  It helps if 


The easiest position is the woman lying flat on her chest.

She can reach back with both hands and spread her cheeks.

Visibility is better, enabling me to find her anus.



The head of the penis is slightly wider than the shaft.

I have to apply pressure for the head to slip into the anus.
However, once the walls are breached, the penis tends to plunge in quite deep.

Really take it slow



Apply some saliva to the penis head


Remove the penis and enter again

Once the initial shock passes it is possible to enter quite deep


The transition from vaginal to anal sex is unidirectional.  I have on occasion washed myself, and then returned to vaginal sex, but I find this breaks the flow.

Initially I would avoid lengthy sessions of anal sex, prefering to orgasm quickly, high intensity

Lately, I've realized that it is possible to prolong the session for upwards of 10-15 minutes

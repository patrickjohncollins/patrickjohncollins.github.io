Title: Cycles

Cycles occur on different time scales.  Some are so fast that we can't see them.  Some are so slow that we can't see them either.

Chain reaction

Each cycle is slighty different from the one before




The sun rises, a new day dawns.  Rays of light burst upon the landscape, bringing visibility and warmth.  Gradually the sun arcs across the sky.  Dusk beckons, and sun sinks below the horizon, setting the evening clouds afire.  As the last lights fade, the stars begin to twinkle in the night sky.  The day ends and night has begun.  Thus the Earth turns slowly on its axis.

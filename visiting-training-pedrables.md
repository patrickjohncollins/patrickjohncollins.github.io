title: Visiting Training Pedrables
---

I'd first heard about the rather oddly named [Training Pedrables](http://trainingpedralbes.es/), a swinger's club in the wealthy Barcelona neighbourhood of Pedrables, from Stefani, undoubtedly the most outrageous person I know, a wildly dramatic actress who lives life to the full.

The rule, seemingly the only one that exists in that place, is that single men are not admitted.  Couples are fine, single ladies too, but men need to find a date.  What divine providence then, that my new Spanish teacher should prove to be [quite rambunctious](/visiting-barcelona-university/), and when I made my indecent proposition she responded with overwhelming exuberance.

We went on a Saturday night, the most expensive, with the hopes that the club would be busy.  We were not disappointed.  I'd been a little worried about the dress code, for I'd been dressing down a lot lately, I had the choice between sandles and hiking shoes.  I went for the sandles.  I did iron my shirt though, the first time I'd ironed anything in about 5 years.  We nearly didn't get in because of the sandles, but my date managed to sweet-talk the door lady.

As it was our first time, we had a guided tour.  We'd arrived at about 1am, which for Barcelona is a little early, the Spanish obviously live in the wrong time zone.  The club was still mostly empty, and our impeccibly dressed hostess, who was quite sexy to tell the truth, led us through the corridors and staircases and murky depths of the club.  The tour was all in Spanish, I managed to catch a meaning here and there.  The catch phrase was: "Sex is permitted everywhere in the club." 

We had a drink at the bar.  I watched some rather light porn on the television.  The gin tonic was rather good actually.  There was an American couple opposite, I fancied talking to them, but my date wouldn't be able to participate in the conversation.  We were in a bit of a language impasse.

We went downstairs to the dancefloor and danced.  My date was very amourous, rubbing her body against mine, spinning around, feeling altogther quite giddy.  An older couple accosted us, began dancing very close, rubbing their bodies against ours, it was tasteful but not terribly enticing.  At length we disentangled ourselves and sat on a sofa and watched the spectacle while I smoked.

We went upstairs to the terrace, and as we walked down the corridors we could hear the moans of women and the grunts of men, capitivated by the sounds of their throes of pleasure.  We sat outside in the open air and I smoked some more and we looked through the glass wall to the swimming pool, where a few naked couples circled lazily.

The energy was starting to hum, new arrivals appeared every minute.  I observed their bodies, their faces.  It was an altogether quite international crowd, pan-European and Asian and younger and older.  I liked the mix.  I saw some very fit bodies and some less so.  Some were dressed like us, and some had already stripped down to a towel or sarong.

I'm holding the small box up for her to see.  It fits in the palm of my hand, although it's surprisingly heavy, which makes it feel expensive.  I explain to her that if I push the button, a car will arrive and drive us to the nearest airport where a private jet will be waiting to fly us anywhere in the world.  She doesn't believe me, so I tell her to go ahead and try.  

She's quite impressed when the shiny Mercedes-Benz rolls up a few minutes later and the driver greets me by name.  She's hesitant, we've just met after all, but there is a look in her eye, a thirst for adventure, something exciting, maybe she thinks I'm cute.  She's supposed to be serving drinks in the bar, but she gets in anyway, we drive off.  There is a mini-bar in the car, I take out a small bottle of champagne, pop the cork and fill two glasses.  We toast, and she smiles broadly.  I crack open some peanuts.

She's still not taking this seriously, she thinks it's an elaborate ploy.  As we roll through airport security and across the apron her disbelief starts to dissolve.  A hostess opens the door, there is a red carpet leading up the steps.  I ask her if she is ready, she just nods dumbly. 

We climb the steps and enter the plane, greet the pilots, they ask me where we'll be going today.  I look at her, she just shrugs, lost in amazement.  I tell them to head for Las Vegas, what the hell, I feel like a party.  They tell me we'll arrive in 3 hours, there'll be no delay in take-off.  The seats are white leather, eminently comfortable, I invite her to sit down first and then sit opposite.  She's staring out the window, looking around the interior, everything gleams.  The hostess asks us if we'd like any refreshments and I order champagne and caviar.  Before long we're airborne, sipping champagne, she doesn't like the caviar, so I order pretzels instead.  It's important she eats something, I don't want her to get too drunk just yet.  It's time to dispel her confusion.

The little box isn't mine, it belongs to my father.  He's wealthy, banking and finance and all that, honestly I don't really know the details, right now he's in Thailand in some Buddhist monastery, he's been there for months, ever since the last heart attack.  I guess he's looking for ways to live healthy, live longer, find inner peace, connect with his inner self, positive shit like that that people worry about when they start getting old.  I think I'd rather die young.

I'm his illegitimate son, one of several no doubt, my mum worked as a maid in one of his suites, he thought she looked sexy in her uniform and fucked her.  She said she was on the pill, but that was a lie, truth was she was fishing for child support, which she got, settled out of court, a fixed monthly sum until my 21st birthday, I've got a year to go still.  It'll be a bummer when the money runs out, but who knows, maybe my father will die and I'll inherit?  My father doesn't really like me, and who could blame him, he didn't ask for a son did he?  But it's alright because I don't really like him either.

He used to own his own private jet to go to business meetings, New York, London, Zurich, places bankers go I suppose.  But then this new service arrived on the market, they call it fractional ownership.  A fleet of jets, perpetually circling the globe, ready to pick you up at a moment's notice.  The logistics are transparent, just push a button and the rest happens as if by magic.  It's the closest thing I've ever seen to teleportation.  My father just said it was a time-saver, hassle-free.

Now I didn't steal the box, it's just that he wasn't using it.  He's got other things on his mind, what with all the meditation and yoga and carrot smoothies.  I sort-of asked, and he sort-of said yes, and until I hear anything to the contrary, I am going to abuse the shit out of this toy.  Since the heart attack the hours have just been accumulating, last I checked there were over 5000, that's a lot of flight time.

She wants to know if we really can just go anywhere.  I tell her we can go anywhere she wants; I just picked Vegas at random.  Normally I'd sleep in the plane, arrive somewhere, get in to as much trouble as I could, then when I was tired I'd press the button and head somewhere else.  We could chase the sun around the Earth, watch the sunset twice in one evening.  I told her that back at the bar she'd said the magic words, the secret password, that phrase which electrified me, that she wanted to travel and never stop travelling, see the world, go everywhere, do everything, get on every ride, treat the world like one big crazy themepark.

What pure serendipity, that our paths should cross, that our lights might burn brighter together.  For the adventure is always far more exciting when shared.  Especially when shared with a hot punky-looking girl with dreads and a nose ring and tattoos up her arms.  This girl looked bad, and I like them that way, I guess I'm pretty bad myself.

I'd stolen my father's American Express card.  There was always the risk his retreat wouldn't make the slightest difference to his health, that his heart would give up the game, and he'd die without writing me in to his will.  I'd rather spend his money now, and damned the consequences.  What would he do anyway, sue me?  

We have wings and we have money, and now we have each other.  Who knew how long it would last?  Best live it to the full.  I've got that tingling feeling, like this is going to be special.  I look at her, she looks at me, I take her hand and smile.  Her eyes are wide with excitement.   We hit the tarmac in Vegas.  This is going to be awesome.

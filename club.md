I would like to form a club.  A club can meet anywhere, but I would like to design and build a club house.  I don't have the finances to purchase a piece of land and build walls and a roof, so instead I will rent a warehouse.  This will be the first iteration of the club house, with the intention to buy land and build a club house in the future once sufficient capital has been raised.

The warehouse will most likely be in the neighbourhood of Hospitalet in Barcelona.  I'm looking to rent a building on the ground floor with access to the street and a door big enough to park a van inside.  The roof should have windows to let natural light flood in during the daytime.  Monthly rent probably between 1200-1300â‚¬.

The warehouse will mostly be an empty box, probably with some toilets and perhaps some partitions for office space.  Here begins the slow process of installation.  I do not plan to partition the space, although it may be wise to partition off at least some of the space to be rented out as storage, at least intially in order to earn some money.

I would like to install a bar, a kitchen, a long dining table, a library and office, a wet-area with a jacuzzi, sauna and showers.  The kitchen will require a chimney, which opens the possibility to having a fireplace.  I would like to install a dungeon.  Initially I would like to have a small room with a bed and a wardrobe where I can sleep and keep my clothes.  Ultimately I would like to have a home outside of the club house.  There will need to be a storeroom.

I would like to constitute an association.  A minimum of three founding members are required.  The association will own all the assets and receive a loan from my personal funds to assist in the development.  I do expect the association to pay me back over time.  I would like to apply for a license from the town council for the association to exercise an activity within the warehouse.  








Money is made by charging membership fees, selling food and drinks, and potentially sub-letting part of the space as storage during the intial phase.

The club house is esentially a place for socializing, but also for production and creation.  Make beautiful things and have fun together.



The club is a private space, admittance is by invitation only.  Only people over the age of 18 may enter the club.  Membership is also by invitation only.  A member can enter at any time.  A member can invite guests.  Guests must enter and leave with the member.  A member must pay a monthly membership fee.  Only members may work in the club.  Membership may be cancelled by a member before the 25th of the month.  Membership dues are payable from the 1st day of the next month.  


I'm going to have to work hard to bring people in, and not just anyone, but the right people.  I want open-minded and respectful people.

Secular, humanist.

Celebrations: soltices and equinoxes.  Organize an open-air gathering during summer.

I have hopes and dreams, but sometimes I forget them, and I find myself at a loss as to what I should do next.  I need to set myself goals, and revise them regularly.  In fact, this is my first goal.  I wish I had learnt this life skill earlier, better late than never.

Good health is the most important thing in life.  To this end, I intend to cease smoking tobacco definitively.  I am terrified of developing lung cancer.  I have quit many times, but I keep slipping back into the habit.  Perhaps I should try professional help?  I intend to reduce my consumption of alcohol to less than 140ml per week, and less than 50ml in any day.  I intend to reduce my consumption of coffee to one cup per day.

My body shall be beautiful.  I intend to obtain the physique of Michelangelo's David.  I need to identify and follow a daily exercise routine to develop my upper body.  I want to straighten my teeth.  I want to tattoo my body with a map of the Earth, a map of the stars, and a map of the solar system.

My mind shall be beautiful.  I want to be friendly, funny and empathetic.  I intend to overcome my social anxiety.  I intend to meditate every day.  

I want to establish and maintain a long-term romantic relationship with a woman, and have a child together.

I intend to see [more of the world](/destinations/).

I intend to be part of a group of highly sexual people, and participate in orgies in exotic locales.

I intend to write and publish a novel.

I intend to open a private club.

I intend to create a 3D audio art installation.

I intend to be fiscally responsable.  On living expenses I intend to spend no more than 1,000â‚¬ per month.  I intend to purchase a home.
I intend to recover all remaining unemployment benefits from French state.  I intend to cease trading in France, and cease paying income tax there.

I intend to obtain French and South African nationality.

I intend to cancel Adeslas health insurance and close my Caixa bank account.

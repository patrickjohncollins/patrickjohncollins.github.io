Title: OS
Status: Draft

Things I'm looking for in an operating system

Lots of tiny little pieces

Everything can be updated

Dependency chains

Interface contracts

I expose an interface, and I promise not to break it
If I do break it, I will provide an upgrade path

It's OK to break compatibility

Keep moving forward

Data is so important
File systems are OK, but could be so much better

Defining types, defining compression methods

Secure from the ground up

Sandbox everything

Where do packages come from ?

Data sync, online, offline, web publishing

web to the core

Handle errors gracefully

distrubuted (as in not centralized), no single point of failure

backups, data preservation to the core

financing to the core, this means paying for updates to components
or paying for media for that matter

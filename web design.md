Title: The design of my web site
Slug: web-design
Date: 31-12-2015

My web site is primarily composed of writing, so I decided to make it read like a book.  A large bold title is followed by a narrow body of justified text.  I chose an old-style serif typeface named [ET Book](http://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/).  Sometimes I break the text into sections with sub-headings.  

### Navigation

I embed links directly within the text, much like Wikipedia does, where I quite often start on one subject and then realize that I'm reading something totally different [four hours later](https://xkcd.com/214/).  It's fun to get lost.

I think menus are a distracting waste of space.  I do include the bare minimum in the footer: my name, the date of publication, the license, and a link to the contact page.

I've left the default colours for visited and unvisited links, as is right and proper.  I would like to add a visual cue for external links to inform the reader that he will be leaving my web site.

### Clear addressing

I try to make the address of each article as concise as possible.  I replace spaces with hyphens.  For example, the URL to this article is *https://pjcollins.org/web-design*.  I would like the sub-headings to be links with fragment identifiers, but I haven't got this working yet.  For example, the URL to this section could be *https://pjcollins.org/web-design/#clear-addressing*

### Translations

A few articles are translated into French and Spanish.  I treat each translation as a distinct article, with its own address (in the target language).

### Feedback

I've not included a comment mechanism, because I find the quality of comments on the web to be generally quite low.  I'd rather receive an email.

### Subscriptions

I've not set up a subscription method yet.  One day when I'm big I'll create a news feed.  Until then I'll keep posting updates on Facebook and sending out group emails.

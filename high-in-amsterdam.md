I flew from Dublin to Amsterdam on RyanAir, a low cost airline (similar to [Kulula.com](http://www.Kulula.com) in South Africa). And when they say low cost, they mean it – my ticket cost just €1.99 plus airport taxes.  Not bad, I thought.  Unfortunately,
to save costs, RyanAir doesn't actually fly to Amsterdam
.  Instead they fly to a town named Eindhoven
 on the opposite side of the country.  I had to catch a bus to 
  Amsterdam.

Luckily, The Netherlands is not a big country, so this only took 90 minutes.

I was abandoned at Amsterdam
central station by the friendly bus driver who shouted "Meet back here to
catch the bus back!" and then drove off.

Standing on the sidewalk with my suitcase, I suddenly realised that I had never
been alone in a foreign city before.

Clutched in one hand I had a print-out of my reservation at the "The Art
Gallery Hotel".  In the other hand I had a map of 
  Amsterdam.  I knew where I was, I
vaguely knew where I wanted to be, and I had no idea how to get there.

I wandered into the tourism office.

"Hi, how do I get to the Rijksmuseum?"  (Apparently, my hotel
looked out onto this museum.)

"Oh you can catch any tram, the number 5, number 6, number 16, number 25...
oh but be careful of the number 16, the one in lane three goes to the other
side of the city."

I blinked.  With mounting dread I bought a 72-hour ticket, and wandered
outside.  I saw a number 16 tram, but I couldn't figure out which lane it
was in.  After waiting a while, a number 25 tram arrived, which looked safe.

"Does this tram go past the Rijksmuseum?" I asked the driver.

He stared off into the middle distance, and then replied suddenly "Yes,
yes, get in!"

I lugged my suitcase in, and unfolded my map, determined to chart our progress
through the city.  Within seconds I had lost track of where we were, and
instead stared out the window as we rushed at break-neck speed through crowds
of pedestrians, bicycles and cars, over roads, bridges and canals.

"Is the Rijksmuseum nearby?" I tentatively asked the driver.

"I will tell you when we get there!" he replied.

I sat down.

Eventually the tram driver let me out, with vague pointed directions, and then
rushed off.

Almost immediately I nearly got run over by a bicycle.

The Dutch really like their bicycles – they
are everywhere.  I gather there are 4 bicycles for every 5 inhabitants.
 The Dutch don't wear cycling gear either – I saw guys cycling in business
suits, and women cycling in mini skirts and high-heeled shoes.  Along
every street is a wide cycling line, with a continuous flow of bicycles.
 The cycling lane is separated by a pavement, which means you have to look
left and right twice when crossing a street – first for the cars, and then again
for the cyclists.  This took some getting used to.

I was attracted to the sound of pumping
dance music.  In the middle of a square, a bunch of beautiful girls clad
in jeans and bikini tops were dancing on a temporary stage.  I joined the
crowd watching them, completely fascinated.  Wow, I thought, 
  Amsterdam is really cool – they get hot
woman to dance for the enjoyment of the crowd.  Eventually I figured out that
it was a clothing promotion – the bikini tops were on sale for €6.99.

After an hour of walking and asking for directions, I eventually found my
hotel. The receptionist greeted me with a smile and handed me my key.

"Your room is on the third floor, and we have no elevator."

Why, oh why, did I bring such a heavy bag?  I lugged it up the impossibly
narrow and steep staircase and collapsed on my bed.  I discovered that my
room did not have an on-suite bathroom (this was at the end of the hall, no
great inconvenience) but it did have a nice view of the Rijksmuseum. 
After relaxing for a moment, I decide to head out and find a coffee shop.
 I'd done some internet research beforehand, using the website <a
href="http://www.hiptravelguide.com" target="_blank">www.hiptravelguide.com</a>
as my primary guide.  From the reader comments I gathered
"Basjoe" was a good coffee shop to visit first.  After wandering
around for about half an hour I found the place.  I walked inside and
greeted the proprietor, a Rasta character with an extremely long pony tail made
from dreadlocks.

"Hi, you must be James."

He chucked.  "Yeah.  How'd you know that?"

"I read about you on the internet," I replied, and passed him a
print-out.

"Really?"  He took a look.  "So where are you
from?"

"South Africa."

"Oh right."  He leaned over the counter and pointed out the
window.

"I suppose you think that's a robot?"

(For non-South Africa readers –
we call traffic lights "robots".  No, I don't know why.)

I chuckled.  "Have you been to South Africa?"

"No," he replied, somewhat mystically, "but I have many friends.
 So what can I offer you?"

"Have you got any weed?"

"Is this your first time in Amsterdam
?"  (Bust, damn.)

"Yes."

James passed me a menu.  "Here, take a look at this."

I've never ordered weed off a menu before.  I found this about as confusing
as a wine list – lots of words you recognise, but nothing to help you make a
decision.  I put the menu down.

"What do you recommend?" I asked James.

"Well, do you want kind of high do you want?  Something strong,
something mild, something in between?"
I rubbed my forehead.  I've never faced this many decisions before while
trying to get stoned. 
"I don't know, something in between?"  I ventured. 
"Ok, well then I recommend the Special Haze."  James pointed to
the first item on the list. 
<a href="/images/amsterdam/Stoner_photo_big.jpg">
<img src="/images/amsterdam/Stoner_photo_small.jpg" align="left" height="192" width="256" hspace="8">
</a>
"Ok, that sounds fine," I replied. 
"How much do you want?  1 gram?" 
How much is a gram of weed?  Normally I just buy it by the bank bag. 
I rubbed my forehead again. 
"Ok, a gram sounds fine." 
"Would you like me to roll it for you?" 
"Yes!"  At last, a question I could answer without thinking. 
James retrieved a plastic tub from under the shelf and opened it up. Inside was
a lot of weed.  I leaned over the shelf.  There were quite a few
plastic tubs behind there.  James began hand rolling a joint for me, with
a piece of cardboard for a filter.  (Frankly, I prefer a smaller joint,
carefully rolled in a machine, with a proper filter. But I decided not to be
fussy.) 
I smoked for a while at the counter, and then spied a group British people,
about the same age as me.  In my typical style, I dumped myself at their
table. 

"Mind if I join you guys?" I asked. 

"No, not at all," they replied.  They introduced themselves and
I instantly forgot their names. 

The group were ordering teas, so I thought I'd join in.  Basjoe offers an
impressive array of flavoured teas.  Each person in the group ordered a
different flavour, and when the teas arrived there was much tasting. 

For a while we chatted and smoked, and then as I became increasingly stoned I
stopped talking and just listened to their conversation. 

"Is it just a rumour, or is knitting suddenly the in thing?" asked
one of the guys.  I pondered this.  Knitting?!?  What?? 

"Oh yeah," replied one of the other guys, "Apparently Jennifer
Lopez was spotted recently knitting."

 "Julia Roberts as well," another
concurred. 

"Kate, can you knit?" asked one of the guys to the only girl in the
group. 

"I can," admitted Kate with an impish grin.  "You know I
actually used to quite enjoy knitting in school.  Can any of you guys
knit?" 

"Actually, I can knit a little," replied one of the guys.

 "Well, not very well.  I certainly wouldn't like to try right
now."  Which was quite prudent in my opinion.  Knitting while
stoned could lead to serious injury. 

Barring the unusual "knitting" sidetrack, the group's conversation
was very intelligent and interesting.  I would have been happy to sit their
all evening listening to them chat, but I did have a concert to go to.  I
bade my farewell and prepared to face the trams once again. Outside I watched
the trams cruising backwards and forwards, and decided perhaps it would be
safer to walk to the concert venue.  Once again, I knew where I was, where
I wanted to go, and still managed to get lost numerous times on the way.

To the tourist, I think Amsterdam is an incredibly easy city to get lost in.  At every corner one is confronted with an identical scene: A row of gorgeous five story buildings,
a canal, a bridge, a side walk café, a tram, a hundred bicycles, and a crowd of
people.  Although every street is clearly signposted (even the tiniest of
alleyways), this just adds to the confusion, because the street names do not
exactly roll off the tongue.  Examples: "Weteringschans", "Snoekjesgracht",
"Gravesandeplein". 

The concert I mentioned earlier was in fact the primary reason I was in Amsterdam.  I had come to watch a performance by my hero Nitin Sawney at The Paradiso nightclub.  I had purchased a ticket online a few weeks earlier.  I presented it at the door. 

"Membership card?" requested the doorman. 

"I don't have one," I replied, confused. 

"You can get one there."  He pointed at the ticket office.

I asked the impossibly beautiful lady behind the counter if I could get a membership card. 

"250," she replied. 

"What 250 Euro?" I exclaimed. 

"No.  2 Euro and 50 cents.  But you can give me 250 Euro if you like."

Wow.  Pretty with a sense of humour.

I paid the correct amount, and went inside. 

The club was packed to capacity and the concert was in full swing.  Nitin was
on stage with an ensemble of musicians.  I stood there, in utter awe, as I
watched my most favourite songs performed live.  It was a magical
experience.  At one point the vocalist stopped singing, and said
"Come on, you all know the words, I want you to sing it for me". And when the crowd sang, they could have lifted the roof.  I have
never in my life witnessed something so beautiful or been so happy.

Behind the musicians was a giant screen displaying the most bizarre images.
 I saw anti-American propaganda, strange tracer lights, and other things I
can't even describe.  When Nitin finally left the stage, the crowd
clapped, stamped and screamed continuously for what felt like an eternity.

I screamed so loud that my throat hurt, and I couldn't even hear my own
voice.  It felt like my ear drums were going to burst.  Eventually
the Master returned to the stage and performed two encores.  When it was
finally over, I felt like crying. 

I later found out that The Netherlands is in a different time zone, and because
I'd failed to adjust my watch accordingly I'd missed the first half of the
show.  But that's ok, because I'm sure I'll see him again. 
I stumbled out into the night, electrified, more alive than when I'd walked in
an hour earlier.  I made my way back to the hotel and curled up in bed,
happy as a baby. 
 
The next morning I woke up late, just in time for lunch.  This is, without
doubt, one of the greatest advantages of travelling alone – you can get up when
it pleases you.  No irate banging on your door at the ungodly hour of 9am,
with instructions to wash, dress, eat and be downstairs in 15 minutes for a
visit to the XYZ museum.  I rolled over and went back to sleep.  At 2pm I woke up and watched a bit of daytime television.

 At 2:30pm I was getting
particularly hungry, which finally forced me out of my hotel room.  I found
a cute corner café and ate a pizza.  I must say, I really enjoyed every
meal I ate in Amsterdam – the
restaurants did seem a little run down, and service a bit stroppy, but the food
was excellent. 

I went to Basjoe’s and smoked another joint.  At one point a young guy came
in and tried to buy some weed.  James asked to see his ID, and when the
kid was unable to show any, James told him to get out.  I thought this was
quite interesting – The Netherlands may be a very liberal place but they do
take their laws very seriously.  In other countries selling weed is
illegal per se; a dealer wouldn't care if the buyer was underage.  I
headed off to the Red Light District in search of the Cannabis
  College, where you
can apparently learn a variety of weed growing techniques.  I never did
find it, possibly because I was so distracted by the other attractions the Red
Light District had to offer. 

I really didn't enjoy walking through the Red Light District, although it was
certainly an educational experience.  When the girls look out at you
through their windows they stare directly in your eyes, and it's hard to
imagine that there is a human being inside there.  I didn't watch any live
shows, despite the incessant persuading of many vendors.  I was afraid to
slow my pace even for a second, lest a vendor attempt to drag into their den of
inequity. 

I happened upon the "Sex museum" and went inside for a tour.
 This was a most interesting cultural experience.  They had a very
wide collection of sexual artefacts, from ancient stone phalluses to painted
Chinese plates depicting various acts to antique fetish wear. 
It was actually quite cute in a way – here were ancient archaeological treasures
that couldn't be displayed in normal museums because of their "adult"
nature.  I bought a pack of karma sutra playing cards that I'm confident
will enliven the next poker get together. 

I went to the Rijksmuseum for some more traditional fare.  I hate to admit
it, but I'm not much of a classic art connoisseur.  As far as I am
concerned, most of the paintings depicted a bunch of lifeless toffs in stupid
clothing.  But, it actually turned out to be quite an enjoyable
experience, for in every room, there were young people with sketch pads and
pencils drawing remarkable copies of the pictures on the walls.  I found
this fascinating – it really brought the art to life, seeing it drawn in front
of my eyes.  I walked from room to room looking not at the pictures, but
at the pads of the artists. 

After the museum, I went off in search of a non-American film.  This was
difficult.  The anti-globalisation protestors have got it all wrong –
McDonalds isn't the enemy – more serious is the global addiction to 
  Hollywood. 

Eventually I found an art house cinema screening an Indian movie.  I arrived
during the intermission – everyone was standing in the foyer drinking glasses
of wine and discussing the film.  I think intermission is a really great
idea – it's an opportunity to socialise (isn't that half the reason of going
out in the first place?), and for those of us with a weak bladder, it's an
opportunity to run to the bathroom without missing anything. 

It seemed a bit pointless watching only the second half of the film, but it was
the last show for the day, and I was tired from walking. 

The film was in Hindi with English subtitles.  The characters themselves
slipped into and out of English periodically as well, which I always find a bit
confusing.  The movie was really serious and depressing, covering topics
such as corruption, politics, Hindu/Muslim violence, and so on.  I didn't
see a single forbidden love affair, dance scene or glamorous wedding – standard
ingredients in an Indian film in my experience. 

"That'll serve you right for watching a foreign film," I hear the peanut
gallery muttering.  Sure, it might not have been entertaining – but I it
forced me to learn something, which is never a bad thing. 

I managed to find my way back to my hotel room without getting lost, a significant
milestone!

</a>

I stepped out my hotel into the morning light and decided to spend the day
learning about Dutch culture. 

In the Vondelpark, a giant park in the South-West of city, a saw a group of
adult men playing a casual game of soccer.  I remembered the excitement of
playing soccer in the park as a kid, the running, the tackling, the laughter.
 I realised that I haven't kicked a ball since I left school.  Life
accelerated – I was busy, building a career, forever working.  I had
forgotten the thrill of scoring a goal.  As I sat there, watching the
game, I felt time slow down.  Sunlight shafted through the trees, birds
chirped, a goal was saved and then another scored.  I thought to myself:
This is living. 

Later, I spotted two guys who were very casually spray painting graffiti onto a
tram station.  The public didn't seem overly concerned – people strolled
past the pair as if they were invisible.  The graffiti was exquisite –
incredibly vibrant colours in exotic patterns.  These two weren't angry teenage
vandals – they were artists.

<img src="/images/amsterdam/Urban_Art_small.jpg" align="left" height="192" width="256" hspace="8">
</a>

Everywhere I went, I saw the most beautiful graffiti.  On one wall I saw a
three story fresco – it must have required ladders and days of effort to
complete. 

Amsterdam has many civic places
– big open public squares designed purely for loitering.  I remember once
when I was young I saw a sign that read "No loitering". 

"What does 'no loitering' mean?" I asked my Mom. 

"It means they don't want anyone just hanging around, causing a
nuisance." 

"Why can't you just hang around?" I asked.  I didn't understand
then, and I still don't understand now. 

The squares were filled with the most interesting street performers. I watched
a hilarious puppet show and later an African dance routine. 
I discovered that there are dozens of secret gardens sprinkled all across 
  Amsterdam.  

<a href="/images/amsterdam/Hidden_garden_entrance_big.jpg">
<img src="/images/amsterdam/Hidden_garden_entrance_small.jpg" align="right" height="192" width="256" hspace="8">
</a>

These gardens are built
on the inside of city blocks.  To get in, you first have to find the
nondescript entranceway, best described as a 'hole in wall'.  After that
you walk through a dark tunnel, and suddenly you're in the cutest of gardens. I
would never have found these if they weren't marked as little green trees on my
map. 

I walked out of the inner city and into the newer suburbs on the outskirts.
 It was a strange feeling – the further I walked, the bigger everything
seemed to get.  The roads were wider, the buildings taller, the spaces
greater.  It may be considered more "efficient" living, but it
will never have the character and charm of inner Amsterdam.

Over the next two days I spent time discovering book stores, CD shops, adult
video stores, and many more.  I felt like a kid in a candy store.  All
too soon, it was time to leave. 

I had to catch the bus back to Eindhoven
 from the central station. When I got there with my suitcase, I realised that I couldn't quite remember
the spot where I had been dropped off.  With mounting panic, I surveyed
the dozens of waiting coaches, and realised that I couldn't even remember what
the bus had looked like.  I looked at my watch.  I had five minutes
to find the correct bus.  Great. 

As it happens, I never did find my bus.  After half an hour I abandoned
the search, and bought a train ticket to Eindhoven
.  Then I caught a taxi (at considerable expense) to the
airport, only to find that I had missed the check-in cut-off by 30 minutes.

 I got to sit on the observation desk sipping a cappuccino, and watch my
plane fly away without me.  The next flight was leaving in 24 hours. 
Being stuck in Eindhoven for
the evening wasn't exactly part of my travel itinerary.  I trundled my
suitcase into town and checked into the first hotel I saw.  The evening
was saved by two beautiful Icelandic girls who followed me into the hotel. 

"Hey, you guys also stuck in Eindhoven
 for the night?" I asked. 

"Yeah.  We followed you because you looked like you knew where you
going." 

I chuckled.  "Well, I've got the evening free.  If you ladies
aren't busy, perhaps you'd like to go out?" 
The pair conferred and then agreed.  Excellent! 

After stashing our bags in our respective rooms, we went out for dinner, and
got chatting.  The pair were from Reykjavik
 and were applying to study industrial design at a college in 
  Eindhoven.  They told me all about 
  Iceland, and confirmed my belief that I
absolutely must go there before summer is out. 

"Would you guys like to go to a coffee shop?" I asked them. 

"Yes," they replied. 

"Have you ever been to a coffee shop here before?" 

"No," they replied. 

"I'll think you'll enjoy this."  I smiled. 

Determined not to get lost, I forced the waiter to draw me a map to the nearest
coffee shop on a paper napkin. 

As coffee shops go, this one was a bit strange.  It didn't have the chilled
Rasta feel of the shops in Amsterdam
.  There was heavy metal music playing.  And there were
dark-looking posters on the walls.  You get all sorts of bars and pubs, so
I suppose you get all sorts of coffee shops too. 

We got high, and I told them a bit about Joburg.  All true stuff: the fact
that you can drink the tap water, the fact that it's the worlds biggest man
made oasis, the fact that there are street signs pronouncing "Hi-jack
hotspot". 

We parted ways at the hotel – the girls were going to pull an all-nighter to
finish a project for their interview at the college the next day.  I felt
guilty that I'd got them stoned, and unfortunately I never did find out how it
went.

The next day I lounged around Eindhoven, and then arrived at the airport two hours early, determined not to
miss my flight again. You'll be glad to know I made [back to Dublin](/irish-roots/) in one
piece.  I really enjoyed my time in Amsterdam, and I think I might
actually go live there for a while.  I'll keep you all posted.

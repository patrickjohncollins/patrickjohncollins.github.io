Oiled skin, dark and light
A suntan line of tanga
Tattoos riding up the side
Throbbing beats and movements
Slow stroking hands
A rocking-horse ride
Tossed with the tide
Deep into the flesh
Sweet delights a chuckle
Gentle skating circles
Warrior upon warrior
Basking in a subtle glow
Sliding up and down
There's intensity now
Fully extended limbs
Contact between bodies
What woman does
Heavy pressure persuades
Driving desire deep

Title: Programming

Since I finished high school, I've been writing computer programs for a living, and I have become rather good at it.  Mostly, I've created closed-source in-house line-of-business systems for large corporations.  If you are interested, you may wish to consult my [curriculum vitae](/curriculum-vitae/).

I put together some [rules for good software](/rules-for-good-software/) based on my experience.

I wrote an example of the type of interview question that I ask candidates for programming positions, which also illustrates through the rather subtle complexity of an [ordinary vending machine](/coding-a-vending-machine/) how I myself solve programming problems.

This website rests upon a free software stack running on a Raspberry PI hosted in Prague.  It was quite a hair-pulling exercise to learning all the magical incantations.  I knew I'd forget them all, so I [documented the process](/server/).

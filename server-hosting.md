title: A home for my server

[My server](/server/) is hosted by the uninspiringly-named [Best-Hosting](https://best-hosting.cz/en/raspberry-hosting) based in Hradec Kralove, near Prague.  They are one of the few companies offering to host Raspberry PIs at present.  The cost is very low at only â‚¬36 / year.  Their service has been very good thus far.  Notably, they had the server live in less than 24 hours.

I would prefer to keep the server physically under my control, however that is impractical as I am forever on the move and frequently offline.  The server is probably better off living in a data centre with a fast internet connection, a backup generator, climate control and other such luxuries.  In truth, I've no idea how tamper-proof the installation is.  Hopefully no-one will walk past and pull the power cable out by accident.

### The long arm of the law

I'm rather impressed by the healthy [respect for freedom of speech](http://nomadcapitalist.com/2013/12/15/top-5-best-countries-host-website-data-privacy/) in countries such as Switzerland and Norway.  I'm not really sure what the situation is in the Czech Republic.  For now, I've chosen the cheapest option, but I'm not against moving in the future if needed.  I'm not doing anything illegal, but I intend to use this server to express myself in ways that might displease some people.  We'll see if I run into any problems.

### Some funny numbers

Best-Hosting sent me the following email :

	Hello, we have just set up Your Raspberry. 
	Instructions for use are as follows:

	IPv4: 193.150.14.102
	Netmask: 255.255.255.0
	Gateway: 193.150.14.1
	Primary DNS: 194.8.253.11
	Secondary DNS: 194.8.252.1

	IPv6: 2001:67c:24f4:c602::49:1
	Netmask: 64
	Gateway: 2001:67c:24f4:c602::1
	Primary DNS: 2001:67c:24f4:beeb::a
	Secondary DNS: 2001:67c:24f4:beef::a

	SSH
	IP: 193.150.14.102
	Port: 22
	login: root
	heslo: **REDACTED**

The "instructions" are rather terse.  Turns out "heslo" means "password" in Czech.  Therefore I have hidden that crucial piece of information from your prying eyes.  I set up a domain to [associate my name with these funny numbers](/domain/).

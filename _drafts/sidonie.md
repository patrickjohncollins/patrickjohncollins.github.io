Sidonie turned to me and asked me if I'd like to try a blowback.  She was speaking French, she called it a <i>soufflette</i>.  I didn't understand, and despite my years of smoking joints, I wouldn't have known what she was saying even if she was speaking English.  I nodded anyway, because she was so pretty and so naughty.

She'd told me before how she used to get dressed up in lingerie and prance around in front of Fanche, her boyfriend, while he watched football on TV, until the sight of her lithe form aroused the devil in him and he flew from the sofa and dragged her upstairs and fucked her sixteen ways from Sunday.

She turned the butt-end of the joint around and placed it between her lips and then curled her hand around my neck and drew me towards her, pressed her mouth against mine and then blew out with all her force.  The marijuana smoke drove into my lungs, I coughed even, which is rare for me, and then soared on a decidely overly-intense high.

Though she was sexy and naughty, she was shy and awkward in her way.  She'd laugh in a nervous tone, underscored by unspoken insecurities.  She needed to be in company continuously, I don't think she could stand to be alone.  She was loud and boisterous and laughed shrilly.  She would kayak down rivers and she had the most splendid muscular form in her back.  She had the ass of a teenager, despite being in her mid-twenties.  She wore boots with heels to make herself appear taller and I'm quite sure she employed the artifice of push-up brassieres.

She was studying geography in Avignon, as was I, and she invited me most courteously to a party at her house that backed onto the river.  I have rarely seen a more charming setting.  Initially she came across as obsessive, chiding me for cleaning a pan with the rough side of the sponge, although once she'd a few drinks in her she was dancing on the tables like the wildest of party-animals.

Once I'd stepping in close towards her, feeling the desire in her, and she'd told me that I was wearing her boyfriend's cologne, and she pushed me away lest the tempitation overwhelm her saying "Get behind me Satan!"  Ah, would the stars have aligned to offer us even one night together I would be a happier man today.

On the 12th of October 2015 I gave 10 USD to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).  At present, it is quite a challenge to serve a website over an encrypted connection.  I'm hoping that Let's Encrypt will make it super simple (and free) for all websites to offer secure connections.  Encryption provides privacy, limiting the ability of telecoms and governments to snoop our communications.

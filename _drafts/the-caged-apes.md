title: The caged apes

There are cages here, row upon row of them, stacked from floor to ceiling, and in each one there slumbers an ape.  I step carefully, my gaze wandering from cage to cage.  I see the ribs of a gorilla slowly rise and fall as he breathes deeply.  His nostrils flare wide with each breath.  His fur is shot with silver.
In the next cage I guess the black ball curled in the corner to be a chimpanzee.  An orangutan is sprawled on his back, all limbs and long red hair.  I study the pink face and white mane of baboon.  The animal sighs slighty and rolls over into a different position.

A human girl, nude

I gasped in surpise

The girl opened her eyes wide, focused on me, and let off a wailing scream

The apes awoke at once, and began to bark and scream and cry in unison

Clawing at their cages, shreaking

The noise was unbearable

It was a nightmare

I ran, back the way I had came

The cages were rocking

The gorilla was bending the bars of his cage

A glipse of a shadow from the corner of my eye, I realized something was chasing me, catching me

The door was there before me.  I grasp the handle, rip it open and [run out](/the-corridor/#post-the-caged-apes).

title: Sailboat circus
date: 2015-12-19
---

Big sailboat, probably 100 feet +

Crew of about 10 people

Crew are performers 

The performance is a way to earn money, but it is also a way to have fun and meet locals


"All hands on deck!"

How could you make a boat roll artificially ?

Trapeze, acrobatics

Singing, chorus, operatics

Marine theme, rich in history


Mermaids ?


I think it is possible to work in a country using an artistic visa


Where would we go ?

In the summer, Northern Europe, Ireland, UK, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, go where the money is

Other summer destinations could be the American North Atlantic, New York, Boston, Montreal, where else ?

Winter in the southern hemisphere ?  Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil

A Med trip could be good too, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, although perhaps might not make as much money from the locals

I wonder about the North African ports, not sure if the locals would appreciate

Don't really want to perform for people on vacation

Bring a boring port to life

Ports used to be places of life, but they have been rendered boring by machinery and security measures

Most cities are cut off from their port


Special requirements docking

How many spectators can one get around the boat ?

Would be great to perform for free, and make money indirectly

Do a kick starter for each port ?  If we can raise $$ then we will perform for free in the port.  

Probably best to have a land-based agent 

Doing a marketing blitz a few days before arrival

Might need to pay other yotties to act as scouts and agents

Pyrotecnics, I love it


Join the crew, requirements: Like the sea, sailboats and sailing; Like performing


Make the story about the crew


Wouldn't be showing off any actual sailing in the port ?

What about with a stern anchor ?  In light winds, sails could be raised without dragging the anchor...

How close could the audience get?

Could they come onto the boat itself ?


The captain

I quite like the style of the unnamed protaganist in the gypsy story
Trying to enjoy Dickens while all hell breaks lose around him


The play itself, and then the actual crew

The pretend captain, and the real captain

Who is real captain ?

Wears gold rings, doesn't trust banks

There has to be some walking of the plank

Pirate tropes ?


Music is very important

Flute
Harmonica
Banjo
Accordian
Bongo drums


To the crow's nest: "Land ahoy cap'n!"


Two stories in one

The outer story is a band of actors and performers sailing an old wooden boat from port to port, in the present day

The inner story, as performed by the band, is a band of actors and performers sailing an old wooden boat from port to port, in a time before the advent of steamships

They collaborate with local artists, who wear tradition local costumes


Complaining about being unable to perform because of red tape


The performance starts when the boat arrives

It arrives under sail, or cheating a bit with the motor ?

The crew are all singing


The captain in the play is a an operatic baritone (soprano) ?
When the ship arrives, they are met by a local delegation

The captain and the harbour master sing a duet


The sailors dance with the local ladies


There is a story of piracy off the barbary coast
Contrasted with a modern day story of actual piracy in Somolia, where they paid for an armed escort


Timbers, ships carpenter, in the old days you could get timber quite cheap, forests were plentiful.  These days it is a real challenge.


Everything is very weather dependent
Hard to perform in storm conditions...

A little bit of smuggling on the side


The captain plays the role of ringmaster

What is the difference between circus and theatre ?

Illusion, smoke and mirrors

Graffiti, street arts, notably on the freeboard, this is all water soluble


It is a voyage through time and space

Odysee, Illyad ?

Who is the main character here ?

It's me of course, but, what age?  40 ?  That would be 5 years from now.

What have I done in that time?

I learnt Spanish and Portuguese

I wrote some stories, read some stories too

I learnt to sail, and sailed around the world

I had a lot of sex, with prostitutes, with porn stars, with swingers, with free women, and a few men too

I learnt to play the accordian and sing and dance and juggle and walk on stilts and slack-line

Body painting and face painting and street art

And during this time I met a number of artists

I invited them aboard my boat, at first I had but a little one

I am the captain of course

I bought a bigger one

The ideal craft

Wooden hull, three masts, full-rigged

Might be a little big actually...

Don't forget the tattoos !!


Choose happiness * Chosir le bonheur * Escoge la felicidad

In a ring, compass directions

Wind rose 


Horizon
Distant horizon

Pole star

Constellations

Winds, gales, breezes, storms
Waves crashing
Rolling thunder and lightning



The crew comes rowing in a rowboat, oars out, straining through the water
They're all wearing caps and breton shirts, and they're all singing in unison

Part of the play is in English, part in French, part in Spanish


Trying to be positive towards sex, sex-positive feminism, I don't mistreat women, I treat them well

Voyage between the old world and the new, from Europe to America and back

What about the ports of Asia ?


Society of control

Piracy is still as rampant as ever

Who was the American man who sailed to Yemen and preyed on Indian boats heading to Mecca ?

Having ransoms paid is quite lucrative

Hold people until they pay, and pay they will

Hold cities to ransom too, simply threaten to broadside



Ease of navigation

The globe has been charted, and the charts have been digitized

GPS signals beamed down from the heavens continually

Not to mention weather forecasts

Boats are equipped with radar, reflectors, bouncing radiowaves off each other


How did it used to be ?  Piles of charts, shooting stars, lunar cycles, tide tables, almanac, plotting course, sighting land

Navigation used to be an art



Containerization, I think I mentioned this before
Cranes replace longshoremen


And of course motors replacing sails, first steam then diesel
Steel has replaced wood


Built in Korea and broken up in Bangladesh



Overfishing, trawling, whaling


The lash

The drinking of rum

Slave trading


Spanish treasure fleet, silver mined in Mexico ?



And what of the future ?

Will we continue to ply the seas ?

Will sail return once the oil and coal runs out ?

Or will emmissions caps prove decisive ?



So, I am having a hard time projecting myself into the role of the captain

Perhaps I need to project myself into a more moderate role, I just got picked up by this crazy band, and I'm discovering them

I might be able to swing that one




Autumn is a lovely time of year, especially in the mountains, where the trees slowly turn red and shed their leaves, 

stone bridge across a ravine

ringing of the cow bells across the pasture


Autumn in the mountains of Catalonia was peaceful, 




After spending a very peaceful autumn in the mountains of Catalonia, I decided to fly to the Canary Islands 

Before the first snows fell 

Cold snap

It was time to head south

I opened my wings and flew across the Iberian peninsula and down the Moroccan coast then heading out into the Atlantic



How do I walk the line between truth and lies ?  


Did this really happen to you ?  It has to sound plausible


What does it feel like to get a tattoo ?



What does it feel like to perform in front of an audience ?  So see them smile, laugh, weep, applaud ?



When I started sailing lessons I didn't think it would lead to this.  I had imagined myself cruising placidly in warm turquoise waters, 

Instead, here I was with a roudy troupe of drunken actors.  The sailboat, big enough to be called a sailship I suppose, is wooden, leaks and reeks.
There are rats.  There is a cat too, to hunt the rats.

The captain terrifies me in a way fey people do.  He actually looks like a pirate, and although I haven't asked, I do wonder if he has ever killed a man.  Throttling with his huge hands.  Or perhaps a stabbing.  I've seen him gut fish, his knife is sharp believe me.

The cook is a bit of a snob.  It doesn't help that he is French.  "Ah, tu parles fran√ßais?" he said with slight disdain.  "Faut pas trop m'emmerder dans la cuisine d'accord?"

Maria is a classically trained opera singer, 

Timothy plays the banjo and otherwise plays the fool.

They all drink, rum mostly, which they store in 5l drums below the floorboards.  They buy in bulk in Martinique in the winter time.

Not quite sure how I managed to find my way aboard

I'd been reciting the poetry of Byron 

Back to the boat I went

Glad I got to know them before I saw them perform or else I would have been far too intimidated to approach them

As the rum flowed, I got to talking, telling stories, as I am want to do, and coming up with ideas for future productions

I'd always dreamed of directing films, never thought too much about theatre

Danger of phyiscal presence, the energy of the moment, 

Dialog needs to be a minimum


They'd had a navigator cum choreographer, but he'd gone off the deep end.  No one really wanted to talk about it, but I gather he'd gone a bit nuts and there had been a parting of ways.

Some people are spatially-challenged, they could get lost in a roundabout, tent ?  I always know where I am.


The plan is to sail down to the Cape Verde islands and then across the Brazil, where life is cheap

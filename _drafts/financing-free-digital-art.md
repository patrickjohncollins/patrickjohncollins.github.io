Copyright

File sharing

Licenses

You get a copy

Even of a website

Your local version



Sharing inside the family

Copyright infringement

Piracy, what it really is

Pirate party

Goverment repression

Business Software Alliance

The rise of free

Free software

Free licences

Creative commons

Wikipedia

Open Street Map

Very beautiful thing

Dilemma, if it is free, how do we commercialize ?

Google uses ads



Set a ransom

Price that the work is worth

People make donations 

Once the ransom is met, the work becomes free


Licenses are not currently stored in the meta data


Often enough, don't know if copyright exists, or who is the creator



Jackpot model

Publish a song

Get famous

Rake in cash for years and years


Earning millions is somehow unjust


Stifling creation


Would like more plurality

To enable anyone and everyone to create


Currents of information

We have limited attention



A lot of content is locked offline

Even today, the best knowledge is available in a library

High quality because guarentee of payment

Enables greater investments


I would like to have all the knowledge of humanity online

wikipedia is a good start

but more individual works are needed too

singular expressions


earnings may be slow
but if you keep creating they can start adding up

what percentage of the economy is directed into art ?

and what percentage of humanity is creating art ?

for the simple love of creativity

it is a an act of sharing to put a work online to become free

freeing your own art




fighting the limitations of file sharing

http vs bittorrent






100% to the creator
1% extra to the network

to finance additional art
to fund the development of the network


ransom can be divided between artists who collaborate




derived works can be made and link back to originals

originals get paid first


encourage remixing



monopolies

centralized too much

youtube
facebook
instagram

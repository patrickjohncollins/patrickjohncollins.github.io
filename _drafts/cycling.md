title: Cycling

When I was about five years old, my mother taught me how to ride a bicycle.  I didn't have any training wheels, so she held the saddle as I wobbled around.  "Don't let go," I plead, as I started to gain forward velocity.  I looked behind me: she had let go.  "I asked you not to let go!" I wailed as I crashed into the ground.  Tough love, that was.

Despite the early trauma, I quickly got the hang of it, roaming far and wide across the neighbourhood.  My father was worried that I was roaming a bit too far, so he sat me down with the map book and drew out a border with a highlighter, a line not to be crossed.  I'd be out cycling with friends, and we'd reach a spot, say the tunnel under the railway line, and they'd sail through, free as birds, but I would be stopped short, that invisible pink highlighter arbitrarily delimiting the safe zone from the danger zone.  Over time, I crossed the line ever more frequently, nevertheless it remained there, ingrained in my spatial apprehension.

The suburb of Witfield, Boksburg where I grew up was so spread out that it would take ages to walk anywhere.  I used to cycle to primary school, cycle to the park, cycle to friends houses to play cricket in the garden.  My bicycle was my constant companion.  The nearest high school was 8 km away, over somewhat hilly terrain, so I [took the bus to school](/to-school-and-back/) instead.  Unless my parents drove me somewhere, I would cycle.

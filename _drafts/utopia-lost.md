I enter the world, I open my eyes, I look around.  The world is full of people, they tell me things, I listen.  Sometimes they astound me, amuse me; sometimes they confuse me, deceive me.  In the beginning, I was taught to believe without questioning.  Fanciful stories of [how the Earth came to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative), the [primacy of my tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid), the [roles of men and women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronormativity).  It's not always easy to tell the truth from the lies.  Yet from afar I heard the pure singing voices of the seekers of truth.  I tilted my ear and listened.  I learnt about the origins of the Sun, the Moon and the stars, the Earth, the oceans and the continents, life, genes, sexual reproduction, species, humankind, migrations, conflicts, all the way up to the present day.

It seems that megalomania is a recurrent human characteristic.  Throughout history, individuals are spawned with a passion for power, and then spends his life forging an empire, establishing a pyramid of violence exercising control over territory and a tribe (or tribes).  Of course all men die, and so a hier must be named, probably a first born son, whether he likes it or not, and so the rise and fall continues, plus all the intervening wars.
There have been a few struggles against these sorts of systems, guillotines have been employed, and thus we've tempered the rawness of it somewhat, with our democractic ideals, where birthrights are replaced with a popularity contest, where the leader is chosen based on his ability to convince his tribe that he should be chosen.  No guarantee that he will actually be a good leader.

The thuggery continues though, even in democracies.

There have been some retrocessions to those former days, military coups and dictatorships and whatnot, but it seems that democracy has become the norm.
Except, democracies across the world are seeing increasing voter ampathy.  Not only do increasing numbers of younger citizens not vote, they don't even care at all.  If democracy replaces the monarchy, what replaces democracy?  Are we heading into a world where we don't want or need leaders?  Perhaps anarchy is on the way in.  Who's going to worry about purifying the drinking water or collecting the garbage ?  
But seriously, fuck all that, because I'm too busy jetting around the world, taking pictures of snorkeling in Thailand and telling everyone on Facebook how truly beautiful it is there.

What would be progress anyway?

Mediocracy?  

I must say, I don't particularly like mediocre architecture, and gosh is there a lot of it to go around.  Concrete tower blocks.

I look at the old buildings that have been preserved, and I see so much beauty in them (describe).  Now I realize that I'm only seeing the small percentage of buildings that have been preserved, many more have crumbled or burnt or been knocked down, and those that have survived through luck and stout construction but also most likely because of their beauty.  When I look at contemporary architecture I wonder what will be preserved, what structures will continue to grace the cities of the future.

But there is so much cheap, crap architecture.  Disposable.  Thrown up in haste without consideration.  There are no purveyors of good taste.  Planning permission seems easy to obtain in these zones of contiguous destruction.


Do we need to keep building houses to house our every increasing population?

Imagine the Canary Islands in their virgin state when the first peoples rowed over in canoes some thousand years ago.

Building roads everywhere
Build them wider, build them flatter
Tunnels, bridges or simply cut the earth open

Great gash through the earth

This thing about preservation
Drawing rings around things
On a map
Natural parks, with varying levels of protection
or protecting the facades

but what about the rest, everything outside that zone?  condemnded to destruction?

horror of the marine environment today
these great big steel hulks motoring across the sea, pumping out their diesel fumes, carrying their lego blocks and bulk cargoes

Globalization

Where everyone, everywhere wears blue jeans

West knows best

Law books get thicker

The walls get higher

The distances between us grow wider

Everyone wants to be a little noble with his house, four walls and a garden

These gangbangers falling over each other to see who can fuck up the planet more

Tourist islands in Thailand
What were once virgen, then covered in hotels, before they move on to the next

And you know what's fueling it all?

100 billion tonnes of oil pumped out of the ground, set alight.

I'll tell you, 90 million barrels of crude oil being pumped out of the ground everyday and being set alight.

1 million people in the air at any time.  That's a lot of airplanes.


5000 snow leopards
50 billion chickens

         5,000 snow leopards
50,000,000,000 chickens

10 million chickens for every snow leopard

do we need so many chickens ?

the snow leopard 

the overwhelming majority of those chickens spend their entire lives in tiny cages with their beaks sawn off to prevent them from pecking themselves or their neighbours to death

do we need so many people ?


struggle between two groups of people : those trying to make the world better and those trying to make the world worse


my own internal struggle to understand why anybody would want to make the world worse ?

do they hate the world ?  do they hate themselves ?  are they in a state of internal anguish ?  it is just pure egoism ?

the people gather together for mutual protection, but this can just as easily become mutual aggression


we've got the lights turned on all the time

can't even see the stars at night time

let's not forget obesity

What is our vision for a future world ?

I would like to see less people, and more of everything else
I would like to see more love, more respect 











This cycle of life, running forward generation after generation

Birth and death

Heavy burden for us to bear through our lives 

Fear of aging
Desire to conserve the innocence of youth


People fighting with each other, what a waste of time, I don't want to get drawn into conflicts, I certainly don't want to get caught in the cross-fire

My security can only be had at the precarity of someone else

Tribes and territory

Brides and matrimony, sharing wealth


Possessivity
Land
Sex


The dog wants to urinate, it urinates, to defecate, it defecates, to copulate, it copulates.  The dog does not hide its genitalia.  Where did we get these ideas from ?


If I want someone to work for me, then it seems reasonable that I should have to work for someone else.

Why should anyone in this world behave the way I expect them to ?

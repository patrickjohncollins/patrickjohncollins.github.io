"Why've I gotta go somewhere?"

"Life's a journey man.  One ticket.  You gotta live it.  Go everywhere, get on every ride, treat the world like one big crazy themepark.  That's the title of the novel I'm writing."

"Well, you can start reading it right now, [go on, dive in](/wings-money-and-each-other/)."

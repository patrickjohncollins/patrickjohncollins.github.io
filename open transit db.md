Title: Open Transit DB
Status: draft

The Open Transit DB is a free and open database of the world's public transport infrastructure.  It contains data about transport agencies, stops, routes, timetables and fares.

The database can be freely consulted via a graphical interface, accessible to anyone with a computer, a web browser and an internet connection.  Because the database is free and open, everyone has the right to download and share the data and to use it in any way they see fit.  Anyone can become an editor by contributing to the database, either by adding new data or updating existing data which may be out-of-date or incorrect.

The database is organized in terms of the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS).  This format, initially devised by Google as part of their Google Maps product, has become an accepted standard for representing public transport information.

The database builds upon the the work of the Open Street Map, a free and open database of the world's streets, as well as the work of the free and open software community, notably Ubuntu Linux, Postgres and Node.

The database is administered by the Open Transit Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in London, UK.  The foundation is responsable for coordination, fund-raising, awareness, public relations, partnerships and legal.  As a non-profit, the foundation is entirely reliant on donations to continue its mission.

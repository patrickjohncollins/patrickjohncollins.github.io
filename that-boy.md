I watched him strike the drums, while his feet plied the peddles of the bass and hi-hat. I was perfectly incapable to follow the beat, to anticipate the next drum roll, the rhythm too complex for my novice mind. He was shirtless, young, lost to the love of his beats.

His room was festooned in flags of the United States and the United Kingdom, his cowboy boots were casually scattered around the floor. There were posters of the Stones and the Doors draped from the walls, and in the corner there was a small shrine to Bob Marley, replete with a bong and a full bag of marijuana.

He stopped playing and we smoked a joint. He showed me videos of beat-boxing while I steadfastly ignored his young teenage sister frolicking in the pool outside with her friends, their maturing bodies clad in small bikinis and glistening in the evening sun.

Dinner time rolled around and his mother brought us meats and salad and a glass of beer, although only one each because I was driving. With great gusto he made me taste a variety of cheeses, which made me remember that despite his rock-star exterior, he was still French to the core. I told him so and he laughed and we talked about life and travel and culture all things rich and lovely.

I knew that beautiful girls lines up to bed this man, and I knew why, he was ruggedly handsome and tanned and he played the guitar and drums and was kind and generous and he spoke with a deep husky voice and despite myself I felt an attraction, a lusty unspoken unimaginable stirring within myself, to lie with him and feel his lips upon mine and grasp his firm arms in my hands.

Could it be too much to imagine that he felt it too, for I made him laugh and I gazed at him curiously. It is an unexpected feeling, the homosexual drive welling up within oneself, something that we men keep so carefully at bay. I couldn't possibly just lean across and kiss him spontaneously, an act so easily executed with the fairer sex, for I was not shy, au contraire, I actively engaged in amorous relations whenever given the opportunity, but this was something altogether different.

Despite the consternation of his mother we got drunk on a bottle of good wine. His father came to our darkened corner of the garden where we had dined and asked me if he might roll a cigarette. He failed in the attempt and I rolled one for him, honestly by that point I could do it with my eyes closed. He intimidated me in a way that few people do these days, but I kept my cool, making idle chatter till he at last left me alone with his his adonis progeny.

Through the rising tendrils of my cigarette smoke I let my eyes rest on his dimly lit features. He rolled a cigarette for himself, freed from the watchful regard of his family who had since retired to bed. We chatted idly, and I considered taking my leave when he invited me into his room. He lived in a renovated outbuilding detached from the family house, which gave it an air of intimacy and privacy which he cherished. I sprawled upon a rug and we drank heavily as young men are want to do. It was unquestionable that I should drive home in my present state of inebriation. He offered the couch, and I gratefully took it. He climbed the rungs to his mezzanine and soundlessly fell asleep.

I stirred restlessly, as the roiling images of muscles, of hair, of the overwhelming perfume of masculinity tormented me. As I slipped further into a drunken stupor, the intoxication of sexual need manifested itself in perverted imagery. Flashes of clutching fingers, of desperate moans, of sensual caresses burst upon the bright canvas of my fantasies. Sleep was fleeting, so devilishly inaccessible.

I lay, eyes wide, staring at the ceiling, my heart beating like a drum, wondering, with a sliver of hope, that he too was awake, sharing my inorexable desire, but alas he did not stir, and at last, glorious sumptuous sleep enveloped me and carried me off to the land of nod. I shall never know what might have happened, had I risked everything, had I leant forward and kissed those full male lips when destiny beckoned.

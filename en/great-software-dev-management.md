title: Great software development management
---

As a software developer with two decades of experience, I am driven to become the kind of manager I have always aspired to work with - someone who not only understands the technical intricacies of the field but also possesses the essential skills to inspire, guide, and elevate their team.  In this article I list these essential skills, in approximate order of priority.

## General Character

* Exhibits high intelligence, high emotional maturity, and high social skills.
* Shares their love of developing software.
* Expresses enthusiasm, positivity, humor, kindness.
* Communicates clearly and effectively.
* Remains calm under pressure.
* Admits mistakes and discourages placing blame.

## Salesmanship Skills

* Understands the business model, business processes, organizational structure, and internal politics.
* Establishes and maintains positive relationships with stakeholders and enablers.
* Proactively communicates the project vision, roadmap, milestones, progress, and organizational benefits.
* Seeks to offer a competitive advantage and operational efficiency to the organization.
* Justifies the ongoing return on investment.

## Leadership Skills

* Offers team members appreciation, respect, trust, and demonstrates that their contribution makes a difference.
* Cares about the health and wellbeing of team members.
* Fosters a team spirit, recognizing that team building requires continuous effort.
* Converses with each team member daily, listening actively, and takes steps to eliminate pain-points.
* Encourages team members to assist each other and collectively bear responsability for the system.
* Identifies and mediates conflicts between team members.

## Staffing Skills

* Conducts hands-on technical interviews, exploring the code base and backlog with candidates, attempting to solve a practical problem in real time.
** _Would you hire a chef without asking them to make an omlette?  Of course not.  A candidate may talk well, but it's only when they're cracking eggs and heating a skillet that you really get a good idea if they know their stuff.  Take a look at a task together, talk about potential solutions, write a little code.  It doesn't have to be production-ready at the end of the interview, it doesn't even have to compile, the important thing to test is the candidate's problem-solving ability._
* Assists with the onboarding of new developers, providing introductions to team members and stakeholders, providing explanations of general business processes, providing demonstrations of the software system from an end-user perspective, providing walk-throughs of software source code, providing rights and permissions to systems.
* Mentors junior team members, providing tasks that are within their ability, while also challenging them to grow, pushing them ever so slightly outside their zone of comfort.

## Project Management Skills

* Promotes short turn-around times from idea to implementation to delivery.
* Balances competing demands.
* Limits backlog length.
* Breaks up large tasks.
* Ensures tasks are clearly specified.
* Ensures tasks include test plans for both success and failure, as well as expected transaction volumes.
* Distributes a constant supply of prioritized tasks to team members.
* Rotates responsability, such that team members gain experience on all parts of the system.
* Continuously delivers new functionality to end-users.
* Seeks feedback from end-users.
* Disburses project budget on salaries, consultations, workstations, tools, hosting, events.

## Technical Skills

* Masters the relevant programming languages, libraries, frameworks, tools, platforms, hosting environments, databases, and data stores.  
* Understands the high-level system architecture, right down to the low-level design of a single API or UI component.
* Evaluates the veracity of claims made my team members.
* Carefully considers the advantages and disadvantages of each possible solution to any problem.
* Provides a reliable virtualized zero-install development environment.
* Encourages continuous learning and knowledge-sharing of new technologies within the team.

## Quality Assurance Skills

* Establishes sensible quality procedures, including peer code reviews, pair programming, automated testing, static code analysis, continuous integration, feature toggles, as well as architectural and design guidelines.
* Provides reliable testing environments, where developers can test new functionality using real production data.
* Verifies the quality of workmanship, both from an end-user perspective, in terms of appearance, smoothness of interaction, ease-of-learning, ease-of-use, and from a developer perspective, in terms of readability, consistency, maintainability, scalability, efficiency, modularity, reusability, and documentation.
* Intervenes when production incidents occur, assisting to swiftly resolve the incident, performing root-cause analysis, identifying adjustments to procedures to minimize repeat incidents.
* Measures technical debt, establishes refactoring procedures, strives to maintain the system up to date within the operating environment, seeks to avoid costly and risky rewrites.
* Ensures all bugs are fixed before new features are implemented.

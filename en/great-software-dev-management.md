title: Great software development management
---

Over the past 20 years of developing enterprise software, I have worked with some managers who were alright, some who were poor, and a few who were downright awful, yet not one who I would class as "great".  

I want to be a great manager.  So I got me to thinking, what makes a manager great?

* Assists with the onboarding of new developers, providing introductions to team members and stakeholders, providing explanation of general business processes, providing demonstrations of the software system from an end-user perspective, providing walk-throughs of software source code, providing rights and permissions to systems.
* Provides a zero-install development environment, for example using virtual machines (dev boxes) that can be easily cloned, and/or a browser-based VSCode environment.
* Provides reliable testing environments, where developers can test functional evolutions using real production data.
* Mentors junior team members, providing tasks that are within their ability, while also challenging them to grow, pushing them ever so slightly outside their zone of comfort.

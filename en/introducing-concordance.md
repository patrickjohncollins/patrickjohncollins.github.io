title: Introducing "Concordance"
---

What follows is a proposal for a new class of social network.  The author has given this proposed social network the name "Concordance", literally "hearts together", meaning "agreement between persons, union in opinions or sentiment, state of mutual friendship, amiability".

# Rationale

Let's begin with a stroll together into the best possible future for humanity.  Walking down any street, anywhere in the world, and every person we cross looks at us with love.  The people feel safe, relaxed and calm, with their physiological and psychological needs are met.  They are mindful and conscientious, they help each other out of the goodness of their hearts, and they do so because that is the way it has always been.  Every child grows up in a home and a community filled with joy.  Every home is a beautiful temple, every stone and timber is laid with the utmost care and reverence.  The primary sound is the wind in the leaves, the song of the birds, or the laughter of children at play.  In this future, we live in harmony with nature, the forests grow wild, animals run free, rivers flow clean, the air is pure.  In school, children learn the history of the before-times, when the world was filled with strife, and they shake their heads and say "I struggle to imagine what it must have been like".

Back in the present, looming highway overpasses are choked with automobile traffic, the roadsides strewn with the carcasses of animals.  Supermarkets sell industrial food that generates illness, to be treated by a plethora of pharmaceuticals.  On my journeys I have borne witness to psychosis, homelessness, poverty, orphanhood, violence, cruelty.  Madness breeds madness, society grows darker, our artistic vision of the future becomes ever more dystopian.  Alienated humans turn to alcohol, cannabis, opiods, dissociatives, whatever they can find to soothe the aching.  Great power competition gives rise to a new cold war.  Autonomous robots are killing soldiers and civilians.  Nuclear arsenals are increasing.  Disinformation campaigns unfold on social media.  Wealth inequality deepens, while authoritarianism rises.  Our overall hostility to the environment is so extreme that our species can be considered ecocidal.  Half the coral reefs have died.  We're fishing all the fish out of the sea, logging all the rainforest.  Biodiversity declines, while our population increases.  We keep extracting more oil, gas, and coal, leading to global warming and sea level rise.  We introduce ever more contaminants into the air, water and ground.  To what end?

It is clear that something major must be done to correct our course, avoid catastrophe, and usher in a kinder future.  The need for global cooperation has never been greater.  By gathering and working together, we can create a ripple effect that radiates outwards across society.  Hence this proposal for Concordance.

# Reaching accord

The network is composed of accords, which spread via invitation.  I may accept an invitation by digitally signing the accord.  Having adopted the accord, I may interact with members.  I may also choose to invite others in turn.  Let's consider a few examples:

* If I wish to offer travelers a place to sleep in my home, and enjoy the same benefit myself when I travel, I could sign the **hospitality accord**. 
* If I would like someone to care for my home and (generally) for my pets during my absence, or conversely care for the homes and pets of others during their absence, then I could sign the **house-sitting accord**.
* If I wish to practice a foreign language, and teach foreigners my native language, I could sign the **language-exchange accord**.

# Adherence through reputation

For such accords to work in practice, members need to trust that others will adhere to the conditions stipulated.  This trust is fostered through the mechanism of reputation dynamics.  After interactions, members are encouraged to provide each other with honest and constructive feedback, and to do so in a spirit of reconciliation where disrespectful behaviour has been experienced.  Before interactions, I may consult the reputation of others, for all accords which we have in common, and decide to what degree I wish to interact with them.  The more I respect an accord, the better my reputation, and the more interaction opportunities I enjoy.

# Path of adoption

There are many people in the world for whom acting with respect comes naturally.  By desire to preserve respect within the network, they would be uninclined to invite those they perceive to be disrespectful.  Wide-spread adoption by all of humanity is eventually possible, and indeed desirable, however there exists a path of adoption through society, from the most respectful to the least.  The network can be considered a social experiment, it remains to be seen whether integrity can be maintained over time.  Hopefully, people will learn to become ever more respectful as a result of their participation.

# Signing an accord

I sign an accord by entering my private key, which is a unique memorable phrase, known only to me.  I do so of my own free will, associating voluntarily with others, for no one should be coerced into signing an accord.  I assert that I am mature human of stable mind, which precludes robots, children and those suffering dementia.  I may only enter an accord once, in my own names, on my own behalf, therefore I may not misbehave and attempt to create a new account under an assumed name.  Identity is important, for we can only trust a person's reputation, in so much as we trust that they are who they say they are.  In scenarios where I have decided to assume a new name different from my birth name, I must provide all names, and indicate the primary.  The act of signing unlocks the accord, enabling me to see the other members and interact with them, for accords are encrypted such that their very existence and associated information is invisible to non-members.  

# New accords 

If I have an idea for a new accord, I may create it using clear and simple language, in a manner that is understandable for all, which I then sign, publish to the registry, and begin to invite others.  I may broadcast the existence of an accord to solicit adoption, or encourage secrecy.  I may not unilaterly modify the conditions of an accord, therefore accords may not be modified once signed.  I could however publish an updated accord, gain signatures, and gradually displace an older accord which falls into obsolescence.  New accords are based upon an existing accord, and inherit the conditions of that accord, forming a many-branching tree.  When I sign an accord, I also sign the accords that it based upon, if I have not done so already.  As accords are made for the common good, they are placed in the commons, and thus belong to humanity.  Accords may be authored in any language, and translated into any language, facilitating their spread across linguistic boundaries.

# Trusted Assistance 

Because there is no central authority in the network, if I lose, forget, or suffer theft of my private key, I may request assistance from those whom I have designated.  For simplicity, the person who originally invited me to sign the association agreement is automatically designated, and anyone who I invite is also automatically designated.  I may revoke any designation.

In practice, when providing assistance, I would need to act with care to ensure that the person is indeed who they say they are.  We can imagine online scammers entering fake requests for assistance in order to gain control of people's accounts.  Ideally, such assistance should only be provided in-person. 

# Death

I may declare that a person has died, and specify to the best of my knowledge the date and time, the location, and the cause of death.

I may declare that a person is missing presumed dead.

If I have been declared dead by error, I may correct this by asserting my continued existence.


# Foundation

The above-mentioned mechanisms of invitations, signatures, reputation, and accord creation are stipulated in the foundational **association accord**, not based on any other, upon which all other accords are ultimately based.  This accord includes a pledge to treat ourselves, others, and the World, with love, kindness, and respect.


As the system is for the living, if I know that a person has died, or is missing presumed dead, I may specify to the best of my knowledge the date and time, the location, and the cause.




# Signatures & invitations

Accords are recorded in a registry.  

If I lose, forget, or suffer theft of my private key, I may request assistance from those whom I have designated.




Free culture
Common ownership

Where is the guiding hand, cathedral vs bazaar

How do accords enter into the cracks of the economy?  And gradually take over?


Stick this somewhere: Concordance does not challenge the primacy of the state, for there is no mention of violence, the threat of violence, or an attempt to gain a monopoly on violence.  Also there is no mention of governors, presidents, or other power-brokers.  There is also no mention of elections, either of representatives or policy.  Nor money or any unit of exchange.  Concordance also does not challenge the primacy of religion.  No mention is made of the supernatural or the spiritual.

# Emotional healing

Recognizing that we have all experienced emotional trauma during our lives, and that this trauma limits our ethical behaviour, I could pledge to heal my own trauma, and assist others to do the same, by signing the **emotional healing accord**.  By signing this accord, I join a community of wonderfully brave people, who talk openly about their experiences, offer guidance, and recognize that the path to healing is lifelong.  As contemporary society exhibits increasing levels of stress, loneliness, isolation, depression, and anxiety, the need for emotional healing is paramount.  Participation in this accord, as with all accords in the system, is voluntary, however participants will undoubtedly give preference in their interactions to those who have signed the accord.  Signing an accord is a form of virtue signalling, enabling like-minded individuals to gather.

Recognizing the need for conflict resolution and disarmament, then I could sign the **peace accord**.  The more people agree to peace, the more peaceful society we will enjoy.  Once again, participants will undoubtedly give preference in their interactions to those who have signed the accord, encouraging the spread of the accord.

# Liberation

Recognizing that my body is my own and that I may do with it as I want, and wishing to afford the same freedom to others, I could sign the **bodily integrity accord**.  By signing this accord, I join a community of fiercely independent people, who work together to encourage bodily freedom across society.

If I want to be able to travel anywhere in the World without restriction, and afford the same freedom to others, then I could sign the **freedom of movement accord**, based on the bodily integrity accord.  By signing this accord, I join a community of globe-trotting cosmopolitans, who strive to reverse the trend of increasingly strict border and immigration controls.

Many other forms of freedom could be enshrined in accords, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of nudity, and freedom of sexuality.  Accords can promote the rights of women, children, indigenous peoples, homosexuals, and other marginalized communities.  We can achieve total liberation in society by first reaching accord, and then working together.

# Sustainability

If I am concerned about environmental degradation, resource depletion, and biodiversity loss, I could sign the **sustainability accord**, pledging to live in harmony with nature.  From this accord could spring subsequent accords on renewable energy, land stewardship, permaculture, rewilding, organic farming, vegetarianism, recycling, walkways, cycleways, and public transit, to name a few.  Participants pool their energies, raise awareness, share information, and implement projects.

# Solidarity

If I wish to offer travelers a place to sleep in my home, and enjoy the same benefit myself when I travel, I could sign the **hospitality accord**.  

If I would like someone to enter my home and care for my pets during my absence, or conversely care for the pets of others during their absence, then I could sign the **house-sitting accord**.

If I wish to practice a foreign language, and assist foreigners in my native language, I could sign the **language-exchange accord**.  

If I wish to offer travelers transportation in my vehicle, and enjoy the same benefit when in need, I could sign the **ride-sharing accord**.  

If I fear catastrophic loss due to an earthquake, tsunami, cyclone, volcanic eruption, or wild fire, I could pledge to offer assistance to others by signing the **natural disaster accord**.  

Reputation is key to these accords, for the more respectfully I behave, and the more assistance I provide, the more assistance I can expect from the community in return.

# Dignity

If I believe that everyone needs a place to call home, then I may sign the **home for all accord**.  There is a glaring lack of compassion in society when some sleep in mansions and others sleep on the streets.  Clearly, affordable and sustainable homes need to be built in large numbers in many parts of the World.

# Safety

If I ski down mountains recreationally, I could sign the **ski safety accord**, where I pledge to give way to anyone downhill, to avoid collisions.  Initially, such an accord would do little to improve safety, as skiers who exhibit a pattern of recklessness and disregard for the safety of others, would also disregard the accord.  However, as the accord gains adoption, lift operators may start requiring skiers to sign the accord in order to gain lift access, and temporarily suspend access to those who repeatedly break the accord.

If I engage in sex with multiple partners, I could sign the **sexual health accord**, where I pledge to test regularly for infections and share the results with the community, dramatically limiting the spread of infections between participants.

Many more accords can encourage safety through collective adherence, in specific environments where potentially harmful accidents may occur due to human interaction.

# Collaboration

If I want to engage in written, verbal, or video conversation, on a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many basis, in a synchronous or asynchronous manner, then I may sign the **communication accord**.  People may continue to communicate via E-mail, WhatsApp, WeChat, Signal, Facebook Messenger, et cetera, however choosing to communicate with other participants through this accord offers the foundation of ethical behaviour and reputation mentioned above.  

If I want to organize or participate in physical gatherings, then I may sign the **events accord**.  Events are open to all participants, specifying the theme, location, dates and times, and capacity.  As above, choosing to organize events with other participants through this accord offers the foundation of ethical behaviour and reputation.

If I want to share my knowledge, then I may sign the **collective knowledge accord**.  From the accord could spring subsequent accords, where participants collectively develop dictionaries, textbooks and learning materials, an encyclopedia, or a world map.

If I want to exchange goods and services for currency, then I may sign the **trade accord**.  The accord establishes a medium of exchange, where participants receive a divisible token upon signature, and an additional token for every subsequent signature.  The accord also establishes a marketplace, where participants may list goods and services that they provide or require, to be exchanged for tokens.  The ethical foundation would prohibit usury, that is charging interest on loans.  The accord would also establish traceability, to ensure that goods are produced and distributed in an ethical manner.  

Upon the trade accord may be established an array of accords concerning the trade in specific commodities.  For example, let's consider the **digital art trade accord**.  Through this accord, creators may publish digital artworks, and set a total price in tokens, to cover their expenses and realize a profit.  They also set a minimum increment, which those wishing to consult the work must pay, although they may pay more.  However, once the total price has been reached, the work may be freely consulted by all.

If I want to stimulate the internal economy and foster individual creative potential, then I may sign the **universal income accord**, pledging to make an annual donation of 10% of my tokens to all other participants.  In line with the ethical foundation, the objective is not to amass tokens, but to create a harmonious society.

# Standardization

If I use the metric system of measurements in my daily life, as most of us already do, then I may sign the **metric accord**.  Indeed, there are many existing standards that can be incorporated into accords.  While some standards may only be of interest to people operating in certain parts of the economy, many would acknowledge the frustrations born from the incompatibilities between differing electrical outlets and charging cables.  Standardization makes life easier for everyone, recognizing this, I may sign the **standardization accord**, upon which all standards are based.  Hopefully, entirely new standards would spring up and gain adoption through the system.

# Information organization

Where necessary, accords specify the structure of associated information, and the actions that may be taken upon this information by participants.  In order to manage this information, software engineers write software components, and associate them with an accord.  The voluntary association accord relies on a software component known as the accord registry, where accords are published and signed.

The accord registry also provides tools for the writing and maintenance of software components, including revision control, distribution, compilation, execution, load balancing, replication, monitoring, intrusion detection, defect reporting, amongst others.  This activity is organized through the **software engineering accord**, which also seeks to ensure high maintainability and security, raise and distribute funds, and mentor novice engineers.

I may access accords that I have signed and the associated information via an application on my terminal, typically a phone, a tablet, or a laptop.  When I interact with someone, I can see the accords that we have in common.  All accords and associated information may be referenced through hyperlinks.

# Community computing

The accord registry, and all other software components, are hosted by a grid of computers, where each computer is known as a node.  The grid is owned and operated collectively by participants.  Participants acquire a node, which needs to be powered, connected to the Internet, and essentially left undisturbed, most likely in their home.  Each node offers processing power, memory, and storage to the network.

My node hosts the accords that I have signed.  Information pertaining to an accord is replicated amongst nodes operated by signatories.  If a node is destroyed or malfunctions, a replacement node can be added to the grid, and the information restored automatically.  If a node is stolen, no encrypted information is compromised.  Nodes could potentially be equipped with antennas and establish mesh networks with other nodes, bypassing third-party Internet service providers.

Participants are encouraged to periodically update their node.  Ideally, they would receive a newer model via courier, and return the old model.  The **community computing accord** would organize the activity of production and recycling of these devices.  Each generation of node would offer increased capacity and security.  Nodes are composed of open hardware components, where available, and when not, action is taken to produce them.  Over time, the network may acquire the resources needed to freely distribute nodes to new participants.

# Get involved

It should be clear that accords have many applications and can provide immense value to humanity.  The proposed system represents a new economic model, based on the principals of accord, liberty, love, kindness, respect, safety, solidarity, sustainability, cooperation, and collaboration.  Clearly this is an idealistic concept, and yet also representative of a deep human desire.  The system has the potential to grow, embracing an ever increasing share of global human economic activity.  Many accords may be added beyond the author's own imagination.

Constructive criticism and suggestions are solicited from experts in the fields of electronics, cryptography, computer science, software engineering, psychology, sociology, ethics, economics, and law.  Please share this document with those who may be interested.  Donations are greatly appreciated to assist me in making this system a reality.

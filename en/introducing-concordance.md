title: Introducing "Concordance"
---

What follows is a proposal for a new class of social network, named "Concordance", literally "hearts together", meaning "agreement between persons, union in opinions or sentiment, state of mutual friendship, amiability".  The network is designed to foster love, bravery, honesty, wisdom, and connection.

# Utopian visions

Let's begin with a stroll together into the best possible future for humanity.  Walking down any street, anywhere in the world, every person we cross looks at us with love.  The people feel safe, relaxed and calm, and their physiological and psychological needs are met.  They are mindful and conscientious, they help each other out of the goodness of their hearts, and they do so because that is the way it has always been.  Every child grows up in a home and a community filled with joy.  Every settlement and home is beautiful, every stone and timber laid with the utmost care and reverence.  The primary sound is the wind in the leaves, the song of the birds, or the laughter of children at play.  In this future, we live in harmony with nature, the forests grow wild, animals run free, rivers flow clean, the air is pure.  In school, children learn the history of the before-times, and they shake their heads and say "I struggle to imagine what it must have been like".

# Dystopian reality

Back in the present, looming highway overpasses are choked with automobile traffic.  Marginalized individuals suffer poverty, homelessness, psychosis.  Along roadsides we see the sad remains of animals torn to shreds.  Supermarkets aisles are packed with industrial food that generates illness, to be treated by a plethora of pharmaceuticals.  The alienated turn to alcohol, cannabis, opiods, dissociatives, whatever they can find to soothe the aching.  The news reports another senseless act of violence.  At the global level, great power competition gives rise to a new cold war.  Autonomous robots are now killing soldiers and civilians alike.  Nuclear arsenals are increasing.  Disinformation campaigns unfold on social media.  Wealth inequality deepens, while authoritarianism rises.  Our overall hostility to the environment is so extreme that our species can be considered ecocidal.  Half the coral reefs have died.  We're fishing all the fish out of the sea, logging all the rainforest.  Biodiversity declines, while our population increases.  We keep extracting and burning more oil, gas, and coal, leading to global warming and sea level rise.  Another oil spill, another nuclear accident, ever more contaminants released into the air, water and ground.  We are driven by fear to rampant competition, wrecking that which has developed over millions of years in the space of a few generations, causing ourselves great harm in the process.  Our artistic vision of the future grows darker.

# Great gathering

It must be possible to correct our course, avert catastrophe, and usher in a kinder future.  The advent of the Internet marks a pivotal moment in human history, for more than half of humanity is now interconnected, and this share grows every day.  This medium unlocks the possibility for a new form of global cooperation, one that may radiate outwards across the society, strengthening our bonds, harmonizing our actions, and raising conciousness.

Given that all social constructs are essentially imaginary, we could imagine new progressive constructs that promote the pattern of peaceful liberation, anchored in a free and open system that belongs to all.  From a tiny seed a beautiful community quietly blooms, gently capturing an increasing share of human productive energy, offering a source of truth and trust.  Always sensitive to cultural differences, and careful to remain compatible with all but the most repressive regimes.  This is the dream of Concordance.

# Reaching accord

The basic building blocks of the system are accords.  Accords spread via invitation.  I may accept an invitation by signing the accord.  Having adopted the accord, I may interact with members.  I may also choose to invite others in turn.  Of the many accords that may exist, let's consider a few examples:

* If I wish to offer travelers a place to sleep in my home, and enjoy the same benefit myself when I travel, I could sign the **hospitality accord**. 
* If I would like someone to care for my home and (generally) for my pets during my absence, or conversely care for the homes and pets of others during their absence, then I could sign the **house-sitting accord**.
* If I wish to practice a foreign language, and teach foreigners my native language, I could sign the **language-exchange accord**.

Some would sign these accords, others wouldn't.  The act of signing is the closest to "voting" that exists within the leaderless system.  I get to decide the degree to which I want to cooperate with others.  There is no obligation to participate, but in order to get something out, I need to put something in.

# Virtuous path of adoption

Accords are universal, and may be adopted by people regardless of location, language, nationality, ethnicity, political alignment, or religious affiliation.  There are many virtuous people in the world.  By desire to preserve integrity within the network, they would be uninclined to invite those they perceive to be vicious.  Wide-spread adoption by all of humanity is eventually possible, and indeed desirable, however there exists a path of adoption through society, from the most virtuous to the least.  Ideally, people will learn to become ever more virtuous as a result of their participation.  Concordance can therefore be considered not simply a social network, but a socialization experiment.  The success of the concept hinges on a pledge to embody virtue, through love, connection, courage, honesty, wisdom, and enlightenment.

# Adherence through reputation

After interacting through an accord, members are encouraged to provide each other with honest and constructive feedback, and to do so in a spirit of reconciliation where disrespectful behaviour has been experienced.  Before interactions, I may consult the reputation of others, for all accords which we have in common, and decide to what degree I wish to interact with them.  The more I respect an accord, the better my reputation, and the more interaction opportunities I enjoy.  This mechanism of reputation dynamics fosters trust that others will adhere to the stipulated conditions.  Thus we collectively hold each other to a higher standard.

# Signing an accord

I sign an accord by entering my private key, which is a unique memorable phrase, known only to me.  I do so of my own free will, associating voluntarily with others, for no one should be coerced into signing an accord.  I assert that I am mature human of stable mind, which precludes robots, children, and those suffering dementia.  I may only enter an accord once, in my own names, on my own behalf, therefore I may not misbehave and attempt to create a new account under an assumed name.  Identity is important, for we can only trust a person's reputation, in so much as we trust that they are who they say they are.  In scenarios where I have decided to assume a new name different from my birth name, I must provide all names, and indicate the primary.  The act of signing unlocks the accord, enabling me to see the other members and interact with them, for accords are encrypted such that their very existence and associated information is invisible to non-members.  

# New accords 

If I have an idea for a new accord, I may create it using clear and simple language, in a manner that is understandable for all, which I then sign, publish to the registry, and begin to invite others.  I may broadcast the existence of an accord to solicit adoption, or encourage secrecy.  I may not unilaterly modify the conditions of an accord, however I could publish an updated accord, gain signatures, and gradually displace an older accord which falls into obsolescence.  New accords are based upon an existing accord, and inherit the conditions of that accord, forming a many-branching tree.  When I sign an accord, I also sign the accords that it based upon, if I have not done so already.  As accords are made for the common good, they are placed in the commons, and thus belong to humanity.  Accords may be authored in any language, and translated into any language, facilitating their spread across linguistic boundaries.

# Trusted assistance 

Because there is no central authority, if I lose, forget, or suffer theft of my private key, I may request assistance from those whom I have designated.  For simplicity, the person who originally invited me is automatically designated, and anyone who I invite is also automatically designated.  I may revoke any designation.

In practice, when providing assistance, I would need to act with care to ensure that the person is indeed who they say they are.  We can imagine online scammers entering fake requests for assistance in order to gain control of people's accounts.  Ideally, such assistance should only be provided in-person. 

# Memorialization

In the case where a person has died, I must specify to the best of my knowledge the date and time, the location, and the cause of death.  I may also declare that a person is missing presumed dead.  Such actions serve to memorialize an account, and halt any potential nefarious use.  If I have been declared dead or missing by error, I may correct this by asserting my continued existence, hopefully this will rarely occur.

# Cornerstone

Before we can agree on anything, we must first agree to agree.  Hence the **association accord**, which stipulates the aforementioned mechanisms of invitations, signatures, reputation, accord creation, trusted assistance, and memorialization.  This accord serves as the basis for all others.

The accord is minimalist in the extreme, including only that which is strictly necessary for such a system to operate.

The remainder of this proposal is dedicated to exploring further accords, which together form a cohesive structure.  It is expected that over time other participants will expand and evolve the accord architecture beyond the limits of the author's own imagination. 

# On freedom

The **association accord** asserts free will, freedom of association, as well as a pledge to embody virtue.

My body is my own.

Recognizing that my body is my own and that I may do with it as I want, and wishing to afford the same freedom to others, I could sign the **bodily integrity accord**.  By signing this accord, I join a community of fiercely independent people, who work together to encourage bodily freedom across society.




The freedom that we wish to enjoy.

building on the pledge to embody virtue


autonomy.
encourages individuals to develop their own beliefs, opinions, and values rather than simply accepting those imposed by others

Think for yourself, do not obey blindly, question authority, servent leadership



If I want to be able to travel anywhere in the World without restriction, and afford the same freedom to others, then I could sign the **freedom of movement accord**, based on the bodily integrity accord.  By signing this accord, I join a community of globe-trotting cosmopolitans, who strive to reverse the trend of increasingly strict border and immigration controls.





Free and open source
Freedom of speech


First-generation rights include, among other things, the right to life, equality before the law, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, property rights, the right to a fair trial, and voting rights. 

Secondary rights would include a right to be employed in just and favorable condition, rights to food, housing and health care, as well as social security and unemployment benefits. 

Third-generation human rights Also known as Solidarity human rights
    Group and collective rights
    Right to self-determination
    Right to economic and social development
    Right to a healthy environment
    Right to natural resources
    Right to communicate and communication rights
    Right to participation in cultural heritage
    Rights to intergenerational equity and sustainability

a fourth generation of human rights is emerging
    The right to equally access computing and digital
    The right to digital self-determination
    The right to digital security
    The right to access one's own digital data (habeas data)[22]

David Walsh, for instance, emphasizes the primacy of the person in his philosophical explorations, advocating for a legal framework that recognizes the inherent dignity and relational essence of human beings

The Right to Refuse to Kill


# Liberation



Many other forms of freedom could be enshrined in accords, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of nudity, and freedom of sexuality.  Accords can promote the rights of women, children, indigenous peoples, homosexuals, and other marginalized communities.  We can achieve total liberation in society by first reaching accord, and then working together.



# Community computing grid

The concept of Concordance could not work using paper and the post office, it is only feasible due to the advent of personal computing and global connectivity.  The question then is, how and where to store the information?  While a centralized database would certainly be the simplest option, this introduces many drawbacks, not least of which is that someone would have to pay for the hosting and administration, which would then require charging membership fees, requesting donations, or introducing paid advertising.

It would be far better for partipants to collectively operate the computing infrastructure.  Thus, each new participants acquires a computer, known as a node, which needs to be powered, connected to other nodes, generally via the Internet, and essentially left undisturbed, most likely in a corner of their own home.

Without wanting to dive too much into the technical details, the widely available and greatly appreciated hobbyist Raspberry PI board, about the size of a credit card, offers a relatively cheap platform, with the 8GB model 5 costing $80 (in USD circa 2025).  Storage can be added via a M.2 HAT+ board for $10, allowing the connection of a 1TB NVMe SSD drive, for approximately $50.  These components should be placed within a case equipped with a silent fan, including a power cable, the total would come to less than $200.  

Note that the Raspberry PI is not full open source hardware, as it integrates the proprietary postage stamp-sized BCM2712 System-on-Chip (SoC) manufactured by Broadcom, which in turn integrates the Cortex-A76 Central Processing Unit (CPU) manufactured by ARM Holdings. 


A bit of assembly is required, hopefully over time some enterprising spirits will take it upon themselves to automate the assembly, providing a ready-to-use end product.

Each node offers processing power, memory, and storage to the network.  Note that the device is headless, having no screen, keyboard or mouse is attached.  The device should be functional without intervention for many years.  The purchase cost, as well as the negligable energy draw are basically the only required financial contributions in order to participate in the network.

It may prove advantageous to upgrade the device to a newer model periodically.  Computing is a continuously evolving field.  As an example, it is already possible to add to the base Raspberry PI board an additional AI HAT+ board for $70, offering neural network acceleration.  Artificial intelligence has many potential applications, within the network it could be employed to better filter search results through learning a person's behaviour.  Indeed, corporations are employing AI to study and learn our individual behaviour, would it not be better to have this capability under our own control?  In another example of extensibility, nodes could potentially be equipped with antennas and establish wireless mesh networks with other nodes, thus bypassing third-party Internet service providers, or extending connectivity into locations where no service exists, creating a form of communal cellular data network.

The nodes of the network collectively form a distributed computing grid.  Data is replicated across multiple nodes, such that if a node malfunctions, or is destroyed or stolen, a new node may be added, automatically recovering all data.  The grid is designed to offer scalability, ensuring the system remains perfectly responsive while membership grows exponentially.  When compared to centralized systems that are more easily censored or spied upon, the grid promotes freedom of speech and privacy.  Furthermore, while attackers may temporarily succeed in compromising a single node, it would be far more challenging to compromise the entire network.

The concept of distributed ledgers has been popularized by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Etherium.  Concordance also employs a distributed ledger.  However, Concordance is a socio-economic system, not a financial system, nor a cryptocurrency.  Concordance does not track debt, because debt is not love.  In cryptocurrency systems, participants are incentivized to provide computing power to the network in exchange for periodic winnings in said cryptocurrency.  In Concordance, participants receive no financial reward; they provide minimal computing power for the simple reason that they must in order to participate.  My node is mine, it is the primary storage location of my own data, hosting the accords that I have signed, and responding to my search requests. 

Because the definition of the system software is hosted within the grid, it is not possible to simply download the installation media from a particular website.  Only an existing node can produce installation media for a new node.  This can be acheived by connecting a USB pendrive into the existing node, waiting for the cloning process to complete, and then plugging it into the new node, which will then start the installation.  This action would not be necessary if the node was to arrive fully assembled.


Why can't the whole thing be hosted on my phone?  Technical and political reasons.

Concordance is thus fully autonomous and self-sovereign, relying on it's own hardware and software, independent of any other network or system.  The conditions of this arrangement are stipulated in the **community computing accord**, itself based on the **association accord**.

# Software definition

While the majority of people have neither the time nor the inclination to bother with the matter of software engineering, some mention of the matter must be made as part of this proposal.  Concordance is based on free and open source software.  Those with the ability and inclination may modify the software.  The software may be consulted and modified from within the network.  

While the matter of software is only of interest to software engineers, some mention must be made of t


# Communication accord

An elementry requirement is for members to be able to communicate with one another.

This name is terrible!


If I want to engage in written, verbal, or video conversation, on a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many basis, in a synchronous or asynchronous manner, then I may sign the **communication accord**.  People may continue to communicate via E-mail, WhatsApp, WeChat, Signal, Facebook Messenger, et cetera, however choosing to communicate with other participants through this accord offers the foundation of ethical behaviour and reputation mentioned above.

# Emotional healing


Recognizing that we have all experienced emotional trauma during our lives, and that this trauma limits our ethical behaviour, I could pledge to heal my own trauma, and assist others to do the same, by signing the **emotional healing accord**.  

By signing this accord, I join a community of wonderfully brave people, who talk openly about their experiences, offer guidance, and recognize that the path to healing is lifelong.  As contemporary society exhibits increasing levels of stress, loneliness, isolation, depression, and anxiety, the need for emotional healing is paramount.  Participation in this accord, as with all accords in the system, is voluntary, however participants will undoubtedly give preference in their interactions to those who have signed the accord.  Signing an accord is a form of virtue signalling, enabling like-minded individuals to gather.



Recognizing the need for conflict resolution and disarmament, then I could sign the **peace accord**.  The more people agree to peace, the more peaceful society we will enjoy.  Once again, participants will undoubtedly give preference in their interactions to those who have signed the accord, encouraging the spread of the accord.


# Sustainability

If I am concerned about environmental degradation, resource depletion, and biodiversity loss, I could sign the **sustainability accord**, pledging to live in harmony with nature.  From this accord could spring subsequent accords on renewable energy, land stewardship, permaculture, rewilding, organic farming, vegetarianism, recycling, walkways, cycleways, and public transit, to name a few.  Participants pool their energies, raise awareness, share information, and implement projects.

# Solidarity

If I wish to offer travelers a place to sleep in my home, and enjoy the same benefit myself when I travel, I could sign the **hospitality accord**.  

If I would like someone to enter my home and care for my pets during my absence, or conversely care for the pets of others during their absence, then I could sign the **house-sitting accord**.

If I wish to practice a foreign language, and assist foreigners in my native language, I could sign the **language-exchange accord**.  

If I wish to offer travelers transportation in my vehicle, and enjoy the same benefit when in need, I could sign the **ride-sharing accord**.  

If I fear catastrophic loss due to an earthquake, tsunami, cyclone, volcanic eruption, or wild fire, I could pledge to offer assistance to others by signing the **natural disaster accord**.  

Reputation is key to these accords, for the more respectfully I behave, and the more assistance I provide, the more assistance I can expect from the community in return.

# Dignity

If I believe that everyone needs a place to call home, then I may sign the **home for all accord**.  There is a glaring lack of compassion in society when some sleep in mansions and others sleep on the streets.  Clearly, affordable and sustainable homes need to be built in large numbers in many parts of the World.

# Safety

If I ski down mountains recreationally, I could sign the **ski safety accord**, where I pledge to give way to anyone downhill, to avoid collisions.  Initially, such an accord would do little to improve safety, as skiers who exhibit a pattern of recklessness and disregard for the safety of others, would also disregard the accord.  However, as the accord gains adoption, lift operators may start requiring skiers to sign the accord in order to gain lift access, and temporarily suspend access to those who repeatedly break the accord.

If I engage in sex with multiple partners, I could sign the **sexual health accord**, where I pledge to test regularly for infections and share the results with the community, dramatically limiting the spread of infections between participants.

Many more accords can encourage safety through collective adherence, in specific environments where potentially harmful accidents may occur due to human interaction.

# Collaboration

If I want to organize or participate in physical gatherings, then I may sign the **events accord**.  Events are open to all participants, specifying the theme, location, dates and times, and capacity.  As above, choosing to organize events with other participants through this accord offers the foundation of ethical behaviour and reputation.

If I want to share my knowledge, then I may sign the **collective knowledge accord**.  From the accord could spring subsequent accords, where participants collectively develop dictionaries, textbooks and learning materials, an encyclopedia, or a world map.


# Standardization

If I use the metric system of measurements in my daily life, as most of us already do, then I may sign the **metric accord**.  Indeed, there are many existing standards that can be incorporated into accords.  While some standards may only be of interest to people operating in certain parts of the economy, many would acknowledge the frustrations born from the incompatibilities between differing electrical outlets and charging cables.  Standardization makes life easier for everyone, recognizing this, I may sign the **standardization accord**, upon which all standards are based.  Hopefully, entirely new standards would spring up and gain adoption through the system.






# Information organization

Where necessary, accords specify the structure of associated information, and the actions that may be taken upon this information by participants.  In order to manage this information, software engineers write software components, and associate them with an accord.  The voluntary association accord relies on a software component known as the accord registry, where accords are published and signed.

The accord registry also provides tools for the writing and maintenance of software components, including revision control, distribution, compilation, execution, load balancing, replication, monitoring, intrusion detection, defect reporting, amongst others.  This activity is organized through the **software engineering accord**, which also seeks to ensure high maintainability and security, raise and distribute funds, and mentor novice engineers.

I may access accords that I have signed and the associated information via an application on my terminal, typically a phone, a tablet, or a laptop.  When I interact with someone, I can see the accords that we have in common.  All accords and associated information may be referenced through hyperlinks.


# Get involved

It should be clear that accords have many applications and can provide immense value to humanity.  The proposed system represents a new economic model, based on the principals of accord, liberty, love, kindness, respect, safety, solidarity, sustainability, cooperation, and collaboration.  Clearly this is an idealistic concept, and yet also representative of a deep human desire.  The system has the potential to grow, embracing an ever increasing share of global human economic activity.  Many accords may be added beyond the author's own imagination.

Constructive criticism and suggestions are solicited from experts in the fields of electronics, cryptography, computer science, software engineering, psychology, sociology, ethics, economics, and law.  Please share this document with those who may be interested.

Maybe I should call this article hydration?


My first drink came from my mother's bosom.

I drank mostly juice as a child.  "Juice" was one of my first words, apparently.


Dihydrogen-oxide ?  H2O

Chemically speaking

Liquid at standard temperature and pressure

Very common molecule


Why do I need water?

Why do I feel thirsty?

Good old H2O.


Could drink other things

Milk
Beyond infancy, I don't need milk

Juice
Lot of sugar, probably better to eat fruit solid

Tea, Coffee
Could do without the caffine

Beer, Wine, Spirits
Could do without the alcohol

Soda
Could do without the gas

Herbal infusions can be nice





Dehydration

I don't measure how much I drink, although I've thought about it.  I try to always have a bottle of water with me.  Simple plastic bottle is fine, if I lose it I just buy another.

If I had to guess, I would say I drink between 4-5 litres per day.

Can I drink too much water?  Yes!  It is called Water intoxication, but you have to drink a huge amount in a short period.  There is also a form of torture called a "water cure", where victims are repeatedly forced to drink and then vomit huge volumes of water.


Dying of thirst

How long can I survive without water?

Access to clean drinking water

Why is it so hard to find a drinking fountain?
Is spring water all that good?
Why is water direct from the spring better than water from a river?
Groundwater?  Wells?  Boreholes?
Water treatment.
Distillation.
Boil the water, catch the steam.  The steam is pure H20.  It is tasteless.

Most important things to get out of the water are:
Bacteria
Salt (sea water)

What are the very serious bacteria that live in water around the world?

Urinating

It goes in one end, comes out the other.

a normal person should urinate 4 times per day, and the urine should be a light yellow color

Mouth > Throat > Intestines > Bloodstream > Liver > Kidneys > Bladder ?

How and why does my bladder stock urine?
What is in there besides water?
It needs to be emptied regularly.
Why is there a taboo on public urination?
Why is it so hard to find a toilet in urban environments?

Perspiring

Lose water through sweat.  Common during increased heart rate activity.  Why do I sweat?  Sweating is part of a mechanism for losing heat.  Allows me to outrun prey, not in speed but in distance.






Make a separate article for alcohol?

I have drunk a lot of alcohol.  It would be difficult to estimate how much.
I had my first alcohol at age 15.  I started to drink heavily at age 17.  In my last year of high school I was drunk several times a week.
Twice a week for 
Alcohol as a drug is readily available, with few restrictions, reasonably affordable.
Want to feel good.

Drinking water

People have always lived near water.
Most European cities were founded on the banks of a river and now straddle both banks.

Problem : waterborne diarrheal disease cause about 1.8 million human deaths annually

Water must be purified

Simple procedures such as boiling or the use of a household activated carbon filter are not sufficient for treating all the possible contaminants that may be present in water from an unknown source

Chemical and microbiological analysis, while expensive, are the only way to obtain the information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of purification.



Global bottled water sales $60 billion in 2006.
Est 0.1% of GDP.

private vs public

The modern water industry operates sophisticated and costly water and wastewater networks and sewage treatment plants, and typically consumes 1-2% of GDP. 

In 2010, about 85% of the global population (6.74 billion people) had access to piped water supply through house connections or to an improved water source through other means than house, including standpipes, water kiosks, spring supplies and protected wells. However, about 14% (884 million people) did not have access to an improved water source and had to use unprotected wells or springs, canals, lakes or rivers for their water needs.

A clean water supply, especially so with regard to sewage, is the single most important determinant of public health. Destruction of water supply and/or sewage disposal infrastructure after major catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, war, etc.) poses the immediate threat of severe epidemics of waterborne diseases, several of which can be life-threatening.

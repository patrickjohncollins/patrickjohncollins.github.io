I always try and put my heart in my cooking.  We sat at the dining room table, facing each other, enjoying the meal, when her phone vibrated.  Someone in the city needed sex!  Like a superhero she had just 30 minutes to rush out the door, hot-foot her way to the brothel, get her costume on and her face painted.  Just before she left she looked at the table and the half-eaten meal, apologized for leaving, thanked me for my efforts, gave me a kiss on the cheek and hit the road.

I sat there alone, staring at my plate.  Long ago I'd read this series by a prositute who said it was tough out there for a working girl to find a man.  She'd date of course, but if she told them about her profession, they'd get cold feet.  Always suggesting that she give up the gig.  And I thought, hey, I'd be up for that job!  I quite like promiscuous women, I think they're bold.  Right up to the point when I found myself sitting there at the dining room table, staring at my food slowly going cold.  I washed up, rolled a joint, went to bed and slept on one side.  When I felt her creep in next to me I pulled away.

This was the arrangement, she was on call from 10am to 1am.  In bed together, kissing, hands sliding downwards, lost in the intensity of the moment, our passionate embrace was broken by the buzzing of her phone.  Off she flew, to have sex with a stranger, while I lay there, my dick still hard.

You seize the opportunity in the moment; people looking for sex don't really wait around.  There's good money to be made if you're down for it, I was quite surprised by the demand.  Barcelona is port city, and you know what they say about ports, them sailors been at sea for a long time, first thing they do when they come ashore is blow their earnings on girls and booze.  Except now they came through the airport, from across the continent, in search of harder drugs and easier sex.  She was lightening their wallets one trick at a time.

She told me she wanted to buy a house by the seaside.  She liked seeing herself in the photos, she felt sexy.  It was a boost to her self-esteem, all these men who desired her, who wanted a little piece of her in exchange for hard cash they'd made doing something legal or perhaps not so much.  And every little piece they had was a little less for me.  As her confidence rose, mine sank.  It wasn't quite working out the way I'd thought.

Long ago a friend once said he didn't understand the resistence to prostitution, after all, sex is never free.  There is always some kind of favour involved.  If a male bird builds a nest to attract a female, does that count as prostitution?  Here we are, men paying, women charging.  I'm clinging to this ideal that another person would have sex with me because they actually want to, just for pleasure and nothing more.

I had a look at the advertisements on Pasion.com, a Spanish website dedicated to prostitution.  It's drudge, mostly pixelated faces of anonomous women offering a good time.  The market is 
Sexual market value.  The elephant in the room.  Attractiveness decreases with age.  For a less attractive person to have sex with a more attractive, something must tip the scales, and this is most likely cash.

Pretty much everyone wants to have sex.  We can exclude the small minority of asexuals.  For the rest of us, the search for sex is real.  Are prostitutes primarly high/very-high libido individuals?

We can't really equate the need for sex with the other basic needs of air, water, food and shelter, but at the same time lack of sex does affect us psychologically.  When I have sex I feel better, and when I don't I feel worse.  Sex is in our genes, we are all here because of sex, and sex serves the primary goal of life: survival of the species.  Prostitution exploits this need.  Could one reproach a farmer for clearing land to cultivate edible plants which are then harvested and sold in a market?  Well, actually, yes we do, but we still wolf our hamburgers down all the same.  The hipocracy is bitter, I recommend mixing in a bit of scotch.

I had expected her clients to be older men, but I was surprised at how many young men were also availing of her services.  Handsome young tourists who could probably obtain casual sex without paying, but couldn't be bothered to put in the effort.  How much time should one spend swiping on Tinder, exchanging messages, meeting potential candidates face-to-face, in the hope of engaging in sex?  Perhaps just paying directly is a faster and convenient approach.

There are male prostitutes, and there are female clients, but the overwhelming majority of prostitutes are female and the clients male.  Men giving money to women in return for sex.  At the same time I hear many complaints from women about unequal pay for equal work.  I believe women are quite right to complain, and to seek equal pay.  But how do you square that with men having to pay for sex?

Cash, off the books.  Nothing declared.  So much for the fight to legalize prostitution.

What about apps?  A Tinder-equivalent?

Trafficking.  Consensual.  Holding a master's degree in Spanish language and literature, having working as a teacher in secondary schools and being at the time permanently employed as a teacher in a foreign-language school, earning well above minimum wage, we can hardly say that she was oppressed.
Women all over the world are forced into sex work.

Solving the root causes of poverty.

She had repeatedly asked me to become her pimp.  Prostitution is legal in Spain, but pimping is illegal.

Why should one not be able to pay for an experience, so long as both participants are consenting adults?

The stories she would tell.  The married man who arrived wearing his wedding ring.  Does his wife know that he frequents prostitutes?  Probably not, but you never know, Barcelona is a very progressive city.  The lawyer who told the office he had a business meeting.  


The guy who came in five minutes.
